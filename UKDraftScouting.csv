Report
"Strengths: Very strong upper body and a reliable left hand ... He shows a strong motor, and finishes well around the rim with contact ... He is very skilled with his face up game and has shown some creative finishing ability ... He is very dangerous on P&R and Pick and Pop, because of his ability to hit mid-range jumpers ... Though he lacks elite explosiveness, he is able to use his strong frame to protect the ball and avoid blocks ... On the offensive boards he is an absolute beast, relentless in seeking out rebounds ... The same thing is true on the defensive end where he has natural instincts for rebounds ... A pretty good post defender, he uses his strong body to not allow taller opponents to get close to the rim ... He doesn’t have the quickest feet in the world, but definitely really good for a big, very balanced ... Potentially he can switch on P&R situations for a couple of dribbles, but needs to improve on his showing ... Randle is a mix of power, skills and balance that makes him a very interesting prospect ... Despite being just a freshman he could have an immediate impact in the NBA due to his strength and offensive skills ... He has drawn positive reviews for his attitude and coach-ability and appears to be a hard working kid that leaves everything on the floor every game and every practice ..."
"Strengths: Young is a very talented scorer who can beat you in a variety of ways, his jump shot being the most notable. He’s very confident in his ability to hit from deep and can knock shots down off the dribble, while being tightly guard, coming off of screens or spotting up. His release is quick and he looks like a guy who could become an expert marksmen with time. Has excellent size for his position at 6’6-6’7 with a good wingspan and a 215 lb frame that looks like it could easily add another 10-20 lbs. With his length and more experience he could potentially become a fantastic defensive player. He’s a lefty and is young for his class so he could potentially grow some more. Crafty offensive player who finds ways to put points on the board. Plays with good energy. Excellent body control and finishes well through contact. One of the better rebounders at his position. Appears to have a good head on his shoulders and is a functional passer."
"Strengths: One of the best pure shot blockers to come along in a number of years ... He's a more explosive leaper and has better on ball shot blocking ability than last year's UK freshman intimidator Anthony Davis. While Davis had a little better lateral speed and ability to get to shots as a weakside defender, Noel's ability to deny his man any daylight to the rim and be a rim protector makes him even more dominant, and a potential defensive enforcer for the NBA ... An elite level athlete with great quickness and explosive leaping ability ... Great length, reported 7'4 wingspan ... Showed surprising ability to get steals using his quick hands (2.1 per game), though some of those reach ins will draw fouls and not be as sucessful in the NBA ... Must get stronger but has the potential to play both post positions: power forward and center ... A good kid, with a strong work ethic ... Competes. Plays with great energy and effort ... His great length, explosiveness and natural timing which makes him such a dominant shot blocker also makes him a great rebounder and ally oop/put back dunker ... Strong rebounder. Shows a willingness to bang inside and fight for rebounds. 9.5 rpg ... Good hands to snatch rebounds and make one handed put backs in spectacular fashion ... As raw as he is, he seems to have a solid feel for the game and understanding of how to play to his strengths ... Showed development in his freshman season, learning to get a wide base, call for the ball, keep it away from guards and make plays, though unpolished, towards the basket ... Has developed a little baby hook shot with either hand that has shown some success at times ... Shows the ability to face up and get by slower defenders using the dribble ... Surprisingly good passer for a bigman. His near 1-1 a/to ratio shows that he passes well and also doesn't turn the ball over a great deal ... His impact on UK has been most apparent after his injury, with the team losing their first game w/out him by 30 to Tennessee ... While he lacks much muscle tone, he does show very good aggressiveness attacking the basket and is ""wiry strong"" ... While his ACL injury takes some of the luster off of him as a prospect due to the unknowns surrounding him returning to 100%, the fact that he's so young and today's technology with athletes such as Adrian Peterson having made such amazing recoveries after surgery helps his cause ..."
"Strengths: Shooting guard with elite quickness and athleticism who flashed immense talent in his freshman season, frequently blowing by defenders and converting plays at the rim with dunks ... Has excellent body control and shows a strong ability to finish on the move, knifing through the lane and contorting his body to elude defenders ... Displayed a nice crossover, as well as a step back, fade away jumper that he utilized on occasion ... At his best when he can isolate and get by his man and find an angle to the basket ... Huge wingspan and excellent athleticism makes him a strong finisher at the rim ... A true boom or bust type of prospect who early in FR season was widely projected as a one and done lottery pick ... Excellent handle for a shooting guard and when combined with a quick first step, he becomes a handful for opposing shooting guards to contain off the dribble ... Shows the ability to drive right and left and his ball handling ability is one of his most intriguing assets, showing a lot of room for improvement ... Has tremendous length with a 6'10 wingspan, essentially allowing him to play an inch or two bigger than his 6'4 size ... Shows a solid ability to shoot off the dribble when he can develop a rhythm, as opposed to spotting up or coming off screens. Still better at creating shots than making them ... His length and quickness gives him a lot of defensive potential ... Does not suffer from lack of confidence. If anything, he is overconfident in his abilities ... His upside is considerable, but there are a lot of variables that must be addressed for him to get there ..."
"Strengths: Fluid athleticism, incredible length and guard agility in a 6’10 package ... Davis is a game wrecking defensive presence and disruptor unlike any incoming draft prospect in quite some time (4.8 BPG) ... He combines the physical shot blocking package of a 7’6 wingspan and quick leaping ability with a relentless motor and high-level defensive intelligence ... In addition to his length, the speed at which he chews up ground allows him to affect shots all over the court ... He has phenomenal recovery speed and can cover up the defensive blemishes of teammates ... Single-handedly suffocates opponents physically and mentally, as they know all attempts within his vicinity will be heavily contested at minimum ... Looks like a natural guarding on the perimeter, with quick feet and exceptional hands for a man his size- averages 1.5 steals per game, an unheard of figure at the college center spot ... Rarely gets into foul difficulty despite his aggressive, attack every shot nature ... Davis uses his freakish gifts on the boards as well, snatching nearly 10 rebounds (3 off.) in 31 minutes of action ... Not afraid to mix it up on the interior despite his frail build ... Highly efficient offensive weapon (13.8 PPG, 65% FG) ... Predominantly an off-the ball target, cleaning up on alley-oops both off the pick and roll and dribble hands offs ... Few passes are out of reach, seemingly able to elevate as high as required. RUNS the court ... While not necessarily a power finisher, his explosiveness of the deck is effortless ... Capable of mid-air body adjustments on errant passes ... Displays the body control to hang and alter release to finish through a bump ... His jump shot form is aesthetically pleasing (71% FT), and its effectiveness certainly can be cultivated with work and experience ... Shows glimpses of pick and pop aptitude ... Bullet outlet passes are a major strength ... Can handle the ball in space with occasional facilitation of the offense, and does not appear limited to straight line drives ... Commits under a turnover per game as a freshman big, highlighting his guard skills ... Still only 18 years of age, Davis grew 7 inches (6’3-6’10) between his HS junior and senior seasons ... Dynamic versatility at both ends of the floor makes for boundless potential ...

Weaknesses: The number one drawback on Davis is his overall strength, or lack thereof .. Despite his youth, he is unquestionably thin and the issue remains just how much weight he can add, and how that added weight will affect his speed and agility ... His shoulders suggest he can build on his frame, and he’s noticeably chiseled his arms, however a thin waist likely means he won;t be able to bulk up substantially ... Must work on his core and lower body- easily gets pinned and backed down in the paint ... Unable to establish and maintain position inside, often finding himself bumped off balance ... Rarely used in isolation post-up’s during his freshman campaign, particularly given his size advantage on many nights and solid footwork ... Offensive canvas is raw, with obvious enormous room for improvement ... Doesn’t yet have a feel for his jump shot, often rushing the attempt and shooting a flat shot ... There are times where he displays extreme comfort handling the ball, but face-up/dribble-drive maneuvers are few and far between ... While he’s a tremendous secondary and tertiary leaper, he too often leaves his feet on pump fakes ... It’s hard to fault him for being shot block happy, but the lack of discipline is not to his benefit ... His athleticism and length won’t cover up all shortcomings against super competition ... Projecting Davis going forward, there’s not much to dislike ... Physical maturity is the only visible hurdle standing in his path to beast mode. 

Adam Ganeles 2/23/12"
"Strengths: MKG is a strong, athletic small forward who possesses the intangibles that can't be taught ... He's at his best in open space, whether it's in the half court or transition ... While most use separation to rise and fire, MKG uses it to build momentum and fearlessly attack the basket ... Excellent finisher at the rim with explosive leaping ability, soft hands and the ability to adjust in mid-air ... Tremendous length allows him to effortlessly finish plays with dunks ... Also able to absorb and finish after contact ... Moves well off the ball terms of angling his cuts as a slasher ... Does not need the ball to be effective or impact a game ... Though not known for his jumper, showed some promise spotting up when his feet are set ... Strong, aggressive rebounder thanks to his relentless pursuit of the ball, non-stop motor and athleticism ... Lockdown defensive potential with the versatility to guard to 3-4 different positions ... Physical on-ball defender with a high awareness level off the ball ... Has a desire, intensity and will to win that elevates his status into elite level despite not having elite skills or potential ... 

Weaknesses: Jack of all trades, master of none ... MKG's biggest weakness surrounds his inability to create his own shot in the half court ... Sometimes too intent on getting to the rim when a short pullup is the better play, which he hasn't consistently shown he has in his arsenal... Lacks range on his jump shot, and won't be considered a stretch-threat by opposing defenses ... Shooting motion has a hitch in it, which will be an issue as he looks to extend his shooting range ... A bit undersized at the next level to get the same easy buckets he got in college ... Could use some work as a ball-handler on the perimeter ...

Overall: Though he doesn't have the typical upside of a top 2-5 pick, he poses zero risk when you consider his intangibles and physical tools ... Instead of saying he has a low ceiling, it's more appropriate to say he has a high basement ... There's not a team in the league that doesn't have a need for what MKG brings to the table ... He's a two-way player that can contribute in a number of a different ways, and while he's not going to compete for any scoring titles, his strengths can inspire teammates and energize a fan base ...

"Strengths: Experienced wing that has been an excellent role player on a championship-caliber team for three consecutive years ... Has nice size for a small forward, standing 6'7.5"" in shoes with a 6'9"" wingspan ... Strong frame ... Quick trigger on the perimeter ... Squares up to the basket efficiently ... A very good spot-up shooter that moves well without the basketball ... Doesn't need the ball to help the team on offense ... Likes to camp in the corner, which creates space for post players and a potential bailout for ball-handlers ... Can put the ball on the floor if the defense over-commits to him on the perimeter ... Capable of making basic moves off the dribble ... Keeps the ball low when changing directions ... Is seeing a lot of success shooting pull-up jumpers from 15-20 feet away from the hoop ... Good shot-selection ... Isn't going to make a ton of mistakes or bad decisions ... Solid defender ... Moves his feet fairly well and uses his strength to keep players in front of him ... Ready to contribute as a role-player right away ...

Weaknesses: Won't blow anybody away with his athletic ability ... Not particularly quick or fast ... Despite improved ball-handling ability, is not the type of player to attack the rim ... Shoots a very limited number of free-throws (only averaged 1.7 free-throws attempted per game in his senior season) ... Upside is limited ...

Overall: Even though he's not the most athletic or skilled player in the draft, Miller has a lot to offer NBA teams ... He can be effective and efficient without having to take many opportunities away from his teammates ... For that reason, he'd be better suited on a team with a star or two already on the roster ... His experience and role-playing potential will make him a very attractive option in the late-first or early-second round ..."
"Strengths: Jones is a 6’9 252 lb matchup problem who had 2 very good seasons at Kentucky … A southpaw with good agility, leaping skills, explosiveness and quickness for his size … Has the ability to make athletic plays in traffic … Definitely has more then enough physical and athletic tools to play SF and PF at the NBA level … Pretty strong and has put on at least 20 lbs since he was a HS Sr., showing his work in the weight room … Jones is a versatile threat who can score in different ways and has the skill set to play in many types of schemes … He is a big threat as a face-up PF, as he has the handle and athleticism to give many bigger PF off the dribble and put pressure on the D … Looks real fluid athletically, which is impressive for his size … Very good finisher around the rim, and makes good use of his 7’2 wingspan and nice reactive athletic ability … Is better and more effective the closer he is to the rim … Shows the ability to take over games in spurts with his versatile scoring ability ... Has supreme natural talent and has the tools to continue to grow … Has some raw ability to shoot as far out as 22 ft., and is he gets more polish with it he will be an even bigger mismatch than he is now … Really runs the floor well … A very serviceable rebounder, especially offensively … Pretty solid at getting garbage points … Became a much more efficient player when Coach Calipari made him play PF, even if his scoring dropped a little … Shows some post skills and has the size for it to translate in time … Able to use his strength and quickness to get shots at times with his back to the basket … Not afraid of handling the ball in the open court, sometimes after his own rebounds … Defensively, Jones has had a number of moments where he gets a timely steal or shows solid shot-blocking skills … At his best, Jones is an aggressive slasher, who can get easy transition run-outs off of defensive stands, crash the offensive glass for easy looks, and hit the open J from the perimeter … Shows a competitive streak in the paint as well, not being afraid of some of the more physical matchups he’s had … Part of a Final Four and Nat’l title team in his 2 years in college, which shows a winning pedigree

Weaknesses: Main question revolving around Jones is about his position, or lack thereof … Many don’t know if he is a classic tweener and how he can fit in certains teams style … Although a very good overall athlete, Jones’ isn’t truly exceptional in any way … He has some of the qualities of a true SF and true PF, but not some of the skills that are most important … Jones is a versatile weapon, but he doesn’t have one trait that really separates itself clearly from the others on offense and should look to polish up his entire arsenal … Really needs to shore up his jump shot and his mechanics … He does not consistently square his shoulders and arms, has a deliberate form, and is a very sporadic shooter from deep, even with his feet set … Jones lacks a mid-range game, everything is either right at the rim or from 3 … Doesn’t look to pass the ball much … Often, Jones will have an extremely strong sequence of possessions on both ends, then disappear for long stretches of a game … Not the most reliable decision-maker … Will try the fancy plays at times instead of using his physical tools to play as strong as he can … Suffers from concentration lapses, and will pout when things don’t go his way … Attitude needs improvement … Does a good job of leaving his ego at the door when it matters most, but has rough stretches and loses confidence a bit too often throughout games, and teams will want to know more about that … Had a sometimes rocky relationship with Coach Calipari, and was called out for his lack of aggression and toughness at times … Can be selfish, and will take shots when he should look to pass or fail to help his teammates on D when they get beat by their man … Matches up well on D against quicker, smaller PF’s, but seems likely to struggle some (at least early on) against true NBA wings and bigger, stronger NBA PFs … Often tries to do too much on the court, especially when looking to showcase his perimeter skills … Will need to improve his footwork more in the post, as he is too reliant on his athleticism and size, which wont be enough against NBA posts ...

Overall: Jones’ size, athleticism, production and natural ability to be a matchup ploy make him a 1st round pick … He’s a very talented player with very good upside and he should be even better when he addresses the holes in his game (jumper, post footwork, etc) … He also has to show more maturity, and we can only hope that improves with age … He has the ability to be a very valuable weapon for a team, especially if used correctly …

Jorrye Nixon 6/10/12"
"Strengths: Physically he's extremely athletic with a quick first step, good size and stays low to the ground ... Teague improved as facilitator as his freshman year progressed, looking more and more comfortable running a half court set ... Teague's at his best breaking down a defense off the dribble and then exploiting switches and late rotations to find the open man ... Looks more natural as a playmaker in the drive and dish game, keeping his head up while showing a willingness to kick it out to shooters ... Really has a solid understanding of how to manipulate a defense, draw off-ball defenders away from their man and then hit his target with accuracy and timeliness ... Runs the pick and roll/pick and pop effectively for a young point guard ... Runs the break with a combination of speed and poise ... Can finish at the rim using his athleticism to elude defenders for uncontested layups ... Can knock down midrange jumpers when given room and space ... Shows sound footwork and promise defensively with active hands ... Good frame and body strength for a player his age ... 

Weaknesses: Lacks NBA range (32% from three) on his jumper with a somewhat unorthodox release ... Struggles with touch in traffic on runners and floaters ... Turnover prone in half court, sometimes forcing a pass or over-dribbling ... Transition from scorer to playmaker could take time, as he still seems unsure of himself as a distributor in the half court ... Only shot 71% from the line ...

Overall: Teague ran the point for the National Champions, showing strong leadership and reliability as the team's quarterback ... He's got incredible talent, it's just a matter of putting it together and picking and choosing his spots on the floor ... It could be a few years before he earns a starting gig, but it's a role his skill-set is capable of filling given he lands in the right system suitable for development ...

Jonathan Wasserman 6/21/12"
"Strengths: Bigman with excellent size, strength and polish … Combines brute strength with a high skill level … Soft hands … Long arms and solid athleticism allow him to be a force in the paint … A tremendous rebounder. Plays with a high motor and enjoys contact … Has a strong frame and a high basketball IQ … Has a scorers mentality. Owns a diverse offensive game with the ability to use post moves and strength to score on his opponent or face the basket and knock down mind-range jumpshots … Has the strength to muscle through contact and finish … Smooth offensive game. Has a soft touch and excellent shooting motion … Good free throw shooter … Has legitimate center size. Measured 6-11, 261 lbs at the LeBron James Skills Academy in July … Possesses great dexterity and body control for a bigman … Coachable kid with a positive attitude and strong work ethic … 

Weaknesses: One of the big concerns scouts have with Kanter is his physical health. He has had a history of knee problems and there are concerns about his knees not checking out 100% when he has NBA physicals … Foot speed is good but not at the level of some of the top inside forces in the NBA … Played one year of high school ball at Stoneridge Prep in Simi Valley, California and was somewhat inconsistent … 

Notes: Has dominated his age group for a number of years in European competitions … Set the Hoops Summit record for points with 34 …

"Strengths: Heady point guard with great size and explosive scoring ability ... Very natural scorer with an effortless shooting ability and excellent instincts off the dribble ... Very quick in half-court situations ... Great first step ... Penetrates the defense and gets into the paint with ease ... Possesses a good-looking runner, which can be extremely useful for point guards at the next level ... A fast runner in the open court ... Makes good decisions in fast-break opportunities ... Great size for a point guard, standing 6'3.25"" in shoes with a 6'6.75"" wingspan ... Uses his length and solid athleticism to finish well around the rim ... Looks comfortable with the ball in his hands ... Creates shots well for himself ... Uses a lot of hesitations and fakes to get himself open ... Shoots the ball often and with confidence ... Already has NBA three-point range ... Likes to surprise the defense with a quick pull-up jumper just inside the arc ... Doesn't get rattled easily ... Thrives in high-pressure situations ... Had a reputation for being a clutch performer in high school and has certainly lived up to that at Kentucky (game-winners against Princeton and Ohio State in the NCAA tournament) ... Unselfish passer who looks to keep his teammates involved ... Good timing in pick and roll situations ... Very smart defender that doesn't gamble for steals a lot ... Has the quick feet and long arms to stay in front of his man and deny penetration ... Highly competitive and mature ... Had a 4.0 GPA at Kentucky, which suggests that he is also responsible off the court ... Only 19 years old with a strong work-ethic and a high upside ... Will continue to improve ..."
"Strengths: Hustle can't be questioned. ... Was one of few veterans on a Final Four team. ... Dramatically improved as a senior, when he was finally given playing time for coach John Calipari ... Rebound rate was solid. ... Didn't commit many fouls despite playing in the post. ... Played within his skill set, never attempting to be something he wasn't ..."
"Strengths: Versatile, long and lean, can guard all three positions on the perimeter… NBA size and athleticism at 6-6, 210 pounds … 6’11 wingspan combined with solid lateral quickness makes him a potential lockdown perimeter defender on the next level … Takes noticeable pride in shutting down his matchup … A tough player, always seems to find himself coming up with loose balls… A good anticipator, gets into passing lanes for steals… Has a knack for being in the right place at the right time on defense ... An improving three-point shooter, shot 39% from downtown this year… Originally recruited as a point guard, Liggins is a capable and comfortable ball handler … Versatile player who can play either the shooting guard or small forward at the next level … Doesn’t have a quick first step but can turn the corner and get into the paint off the dribble … Can cover a lot of ground quickly due to his long stride … Understands his role and doesn’t force his offense … 

Weaknesses: Unclear whether he’ll be able to contribute offensively on an NBA roster … Good, but not great athlete … Poor free throw shooter …Career high in points over his three year career at Kentucky is only 19 points… Jump shot is funky looking and inconsistent… A decent shooter when his feet are set, Liggins really struggles to make shots after he puts the ball on the floor… Though he cut down considerably on his turnovers this year, is still a shaky decision maker … Never averaged more than 8.6 points per game in college … Lacks consistency … At 23 years-old, very old for a junior … Does not move well on offense, can get caught standing around watching …Will have to develop more offensive moves and a midrange game … Struggles to finish around the rim in traffic … Emotional player who can sometimes let emotions get the better of him … Spent his entire college career as a role player and reserve

Notes: Hit a game clinching three against North Carolina to help Kentucky advance to the Final Four ... Highly touted out of high school, was considered the crown jewel of Billy Gillespie’s first recruiting class at Kentucky in 2008… Attended Findley Prep for one year after his senior year of high school, which is why he is one year older than most of his junior classmates…

"NBA Comparison: Derrick Rose/Russell Westbrook

Strengths:  One of the most electrifying players to come out of the college ranks in years ... Has an heir of supremacy/confidence that only the truly great ones possess ... His speed in the open floor and first step blow by ability is absolutely jaw dropping ... His body control and ability to make plays around the rim as well as find teammates with passes while playing at such a break neck speed is what sets him apart. At first you think he's out of control but he actually makes great decisions while playing at such a fast pace ... Fearless attacking the basket off the dribble and seems to find a space in the defense when it isn't there ... His ability to contort his body and finish from all angles around the basket with both hands borders on the absurd ... There is a ton of room for growth and improvement, and his style of play (SPEED) is tailor made for the NBA level ... Point guards with his size and athleticism are rare, Rose and Westbrook are two of the most athletic lead guards to come along in years, and Wall has some of each of their attributes ... Possesses elite athletic ability with unusual length and explosiveness for a point guard ... Excellent finisher in transition with both hands and his speed and ability to change direction allows him to get any place he wants on the floor ... Pushes the ball up the floor as well as any 6-foot point guard ... Can become dominant at both ends of the floor being able to use his length as both a defensive stopper and above average rebounder from the wing ... An excellent passer, particularly on the move. Can pick a part a defense setting up teammates for easy scores using his great vision, and creativity ... A true floor general, not just an athlete masquerading as a point ... Huge hands give him excellent command of the basketball ... Good ball handler with either hand ... A ball hawk able to rip opposing point guards using his quick hands and feet and long arms. Excellent anticipation on passes contributed to his 1.8 steals per game ... Shows leadership ability and will look to become a more vocal leader as he matures ... Has a chance to be a merchandising phenomenon with his incredible talent and charisma ... 

Weaknesses: Similar to Derrick Rose entering the league, Wall's jumpshot is a work in progress ... Shooting is the easiest skill to improve upon in the league and Wall's shooting form is not horrible, but it will require some tweaking and hard work (repetition) in the gym to become a real strength to his game ... Wall is not a good set shooter, preferring to create a rhythm using the bounce. His shot lacks great lift and is a little slow to get off. His form and release are decent, but should look to get a little more trajectory ... At times it appears Wall is too caught up in impressing instead of focusing on the ultimate goal of winning ... More comfortable operating in the open floor than in the half court ... Will need to hone his pick and roll skills and half court command of the game ... His ability to get into the lane and make plays around the basket in the half court game is more effective than his jump shooting ... While possibly even quicker than Rose, he lacks the same body strength and ability to absorb contact. Adding some core body strength would allow him to finish stronger around the rim ... Gets careless passing the ball at times. 4 turnovers per game show his lack of ball protection and that his point guard skills are still raw. His 1.6 a/to ratio is solid for a freshman but should be better for such an elite level player ... Wall is blessed with such incredible physical gifts that it will be up to him to put in the work to get the most out of his abilities. Too often the most talented players aren't the ones willing to work the hardest, and at such a young age it's too early to definitively say whether he ""wants it"" ... Competitive player, but will need to develop his killer instinct and ability to take over at the end of games ... 

Outlook: A virtual lock for the first pick in the 2010 draft ... Led Kentucky to the Elite Eight with just 3 losses all year in his one season in college ... Hit a game winning shot with .5 on the clock in his first ever college basketball game ...

"Strengths: Utilized his 3rd year to more fully develop his game, as he was relinquished of his duties of being the featured scorer with the help of Cousins, Wall and Bledsoe ... Patterson has an excellent build for an NBA forward, and uses that to his advantage down low ... Good feel for the basket, soft hands, seems to convert at a high rate with fundamental post moves, in particular a baby hook shot, when establishing solid position down low ... Shows good toughness and a power forward's demeanor ... This past year he developed a smooth outside jump shot with encouraging mechanics for a big man, working well when spotting up off a catch and shoot ... His understanding of the game and his mid-range stroke make him a likely candidate to be an efficient pick and roll player down the road ... Patterson has a high basketball IQ, seems to know his limitations, while his work ethic and maturity will likely improve the chances of him earning plentiful rookie minutes ... Defensively, in the paint, he can use his length to contest shots, and with a focus on using his strength to body up and play physical, he has the potential to be a nice post defender ...

Weaknesses: If there is one thing Patterson is missing, it's a face-up part of his game... It's difficult to remember a time where he ever tried to beat his man or take a jump shot off the dribble this past year... For his build and strength, he is not the greatest rebounder, and at the next level when going up against taller and equally strong forwards, he could be a liability on the defensive glass ... When guarding more athletic and quicker forwards like Josh Smith, he could have a difficult time defending on the perimeter (although it seems his footwork and agility have improved over the past year) ... Lacks defensive awareness, and will need to work on his help defense and positioning off the ball ...

Overall:  A smart, mature kid who understands his role, Patterson looks like the typical productive power forward that GMs know exactly what they are going to get when they draft him... Not the highest upside, but a safe and reliable pick who rarely turns the ball over and just screams efficiency... With his improved jump shot, and the ability to add a few post moves to his repertoire, Patterson could be a nice fit right away for a team looking for stability at the 4 position, especially if they already have an established rebounding center ... 

Jonathan Wasserman 2/27/10

Strengths: Patterson possesses an NBA-ready body and outstanding physical abilities ... Has the demeanor you want in a post player, as he relishes contact and has the willingness to bang inside ... One of the most efficient players in the SEC at 18 PPG (.664 FG% and 1.66 PPS), 9.3 RPG and 2.0 BLK ... He is a warrior inside who understands how to play post position with his back to the basket and relies on his deep position under the basket ... One of the toughest players in the league ... Does a great job of fighting for and holding down his position inside (if he doesn’t feel he is in a good position to catch the ball he will repost and fight for better position) ... Patterson overpowers, out muscles and out wills most of his opponents inside ... Possesses great timing on put-backs, rebounds and 2nd shot opportunities ... His go-to move is to catch the ball inside and turn to his left shoulder and use his right hand baby hook effectively or drop-step and go for dunk ... Patterson is very explosive and aggressive off the ground when attacking the rim ... He has improved his game since last year and developed a solid outside shot from 15-16 feet (on the low post he can even turn around and shoot it off the glass) ... He is very quick at changing directions, and shows solid ability to beat slower defenders off the dribble ... Has the ability to draw contact first and score ... Very good free-throw shooter at .778 % this year so far ... Patterson also improved his rebounding ability (going from 7.7 RPG per game to 9.5 RPG per game this year) ... Although he relied mostly on his body in the past, this year he has learned to box out better and make better use of his 7′2″ wingspan ... Average passer with good court vision (recognizes double teams and will try to find open teammate for the open jump-shot) ... Runs the floor well for his size ... On the defensive end his mobility, long arms, body and athleticism make him solid ... Patterson has good timing for blocking shots (2 BPG) ... Possesses good lateral quickness for his size ... Got his confidence back from last year’s injury (stress fracture in left ankle) ... Despite being undersized, Patterson possesses the heart, determination, and athleticism to overcome these shortcomings. It also helps him that smaller power forwards such as Paul Millsap are having success in the NBA ..."
"NBA Comparison: Keyon Dooling/Marcus Banks

Strengths: Freshman point guard blessed with rare athletic gifts ... Combines great length with tremendous explosiveness ... Has a lightning quick first step that makes him almost impossible to stay in front of ... Makes his moves very decisively and changes direction abruptly without losing stride ... His speed with the rock, especially in the open court, is remarkable ... Has a powerful, chiseled frame for a guard that helps mask his height deficiency ... When he gets a full head of steam - look out. He's like a running back in the open field ... His upper body strength allows him to finish through punishing blows ... Uses his left hand very adroitly around the rim ... An impressive leaper, rising to the rim with relative ease and throwing down some impressive jams ... Exhibits the ability to hang and adjust shots mid-flight ... Has a knack for hitting shots of the circus variety on a fairly regular basis. Never loses sight of the hoop, even when contorting his body. Despite being asked to fill more of a scorer's role than he’s accustomed to (11 point per game), has not forced his offense. Shot 47% on 9 shots per contest this season ... Three point accuracy has been a pleasant surprise, knocking down 41% on nearly 4 attempts per game. (showed improvement late in the year) ... A solid passer (3 assists per), especially in transition where he can use his instincts rather than reading defenses ... His superb lateral quickness, foot speed and freakish wingspan make him a potential lock down defender ... Clutch. Has stepped in the NCAA tournament showing his ability to play well in pressure situations ... 

Weaknesses: Turnovers have been a problem at 3 per game ... Decision making has been questionable at times, as he tends to continually play on fast forward- this can be partially attributed to the chaotic style Kentucky plays ... Goes through phases where he has tunnel vision towards the basket, dribbling with his head down and not paying any attention to the defensive alignment ... Leaves his feet to pass on many occasions, which often results in an offensive foul or no place to pass and a turnover ... Despite his strength, settles for too many wild layups in an attempt to avoid contact when he should be seeking it out (attempts only 3 FT's per) ... Extremely limited elevation on his jumper, shooting more of a set shot (should look to adjust his shooting form ... Has a slow release and takes too much time getting his body underneath the shot ... Rarely takes advantage of the mid-range game- will take the occasional short jumper only if left unguarded ... While he's had some massive performances this year, there are too many clunkers thrown in ... When he struggles in the early going of games he can mentally check out for the remainder ... Needs to find ways to impact the result when not on his A game. 

Notes: Blesdoe was recruited as a point guard out of High School, but with the presence of John Wall has played mostly two guard. It's difficult to appraise his floor leadership and game management until he has the full lead guard reins. Due to that he is regarded as a high risk, high reward, potential based draft pick ...

Adam Ganeles 3/24/10"
"Strengths: An intriguing big with a next level body and an extremely long wingspan … He has a wide and developed frame and has the potential to add further mass … A deceptive athlete, he gets off the ground well and sneaks up on people thanks to his length … Physically, he has all the tools to be an inside force in the future … Off the catch, he powers his way to the hoop for strong finishes, he has the wide shoulders to clear space inside and convert against contact … Shows a fairly soft touch around the basket, he extends on his hook shot and is able to convert plays with finesse … Comfortable stepping out to midrange and knocking down spot up jumpers … His form is extremely smooth for a big, and he is able to get his shot off with good speed and rhythm … Has a lot of potential as a pick and roll big because of his ability to shoot the ball and set wide screens … Currently, most of his value is on the defensive end … He is able to keep defensive position because of his size, but more importantly he blocks and alters a high percentage of shots thanks to his timing and length …

Weaknesses: At this point, he is still a very raw player who has not performed consistently at a high level … Most of his intrigue lies in his potential, but over the last few seasons he has not produced much … Very careless with the ball, he makes poor decisions and throws it away very frequently … He tries to make passes that have no chance of finding the target … Has a bad habit of throwing outlet passes when he is off balance and when no one is looking for the ball … Missed the majority of his High School senior season due to surgery on his left knee … Whether it is the result of his injury or just his natural gait, his running and movements are not smooth and it seems like he is wasting too much energy while getting up and down the court … Needs to become a better shooter at the free throw line … Fell victim to the system that catered to other players at Kentucky, and was not able to get much game experience operating in the post on the offensive end … He lacks confidence in his scoring ability and does not look to establish good position on the block … Could have used another season of college to polish his game and prove that he can be effective as one of the featured players …"
"Strengths: Center prospect with the size and skill set to make a strong impact at both ends of the floor in the NBA ... Hard worker, smart kid, with strength of character ... Shows desire and a competitive nature ... Possesses a great feel for the game ... Offensive game oozes potential with a text book shooting form, great touch and ability to hit outside and mid range jumpers effortlessly and consistently ... Has even implemented a steadily improving hook shot into his repertoire ... His length and strong body gives him excellent ability to rebound and hold position in the post ... Tremendous rebounder on a per 40 minute basis, with big hands, good box out fundamentals, post positioning and energy ... Has worked hard on his body and has developed broad shoulders and good strength ... Should be able to add additional weight and play comfortably in the 260-270 range ... Shows a willingness to play physical and fight in the post ... Terrific passer, good vision, he's able to find players when doubled, and even have the offense run through him at the high post ... Very good shot blocker. Though not a huge leaper, has excellent timing and shows the ability to use his great length as a rim protector ... Shows better speed than quickness, and can really motor once he gets a head of steam ... Hustles and shows the willingness to defend and play hard ... Underrated foot speed and perimeter defensive ability ... Doesn't seem to get winded easily, though the UK platoon system helps in this area ... Has shown the ability to defend players much smaller than himself with success on the perimeter ... 

Weaknesses: Has struggled mightily with his post offense early in the season. Post play, foot work and confidence on the block needs a lot of work ... Still appears to be growing into his body, movements are gangly ... A very solid athlete, but not the most explosive leaper without momentum, though he's shown the ability to dunk from the free throw line, so he's not exactly a plodder ... Second jump leaping not a strong point ... Appears to leap better off of one foot than two which is better for wing players ... Huge feet seem to weigh him down some and challenge his ability to make quick moves from a standstill position ... Has shown a tendency to get in foul trouble and the current ""platoon system"" at Kentucky does not allow scouts to accurately judge his ability to play full games and stay out of foul trouble ... Has a lot less pressure to produce on a daily basis on a stacked UK team. It's easy to look good when teams are not able to focus all of their attention on a player the caliber of Towns. Coach Calipari's system also does an excellent job of showcasing a player's strengths while masking their weaknesses ... Top heavy. Despite showing a huge set of arms and shoulders, his lower body strength needs work, as he gets knocked off balance and pushed around at times. Balance can improve. Granted, considering his age and work ethic, these are not hugely concerning issues ... 

Notes: Measured 6'11.5 (in shoes) 235 lbs, with a 7'3.5 wingspan at the 2013 Nike Big Man Skills Academy ... One of three prospects in the 2015 draft (along with Mudiay and Okafor) with franchise potential ... Just scratching the surface of his abilities, and appears to have a lot of upside left to develop ... Mother hails from Dominican Republic ... Less polished and proven than Duke center Jahlil Okafor , but we view him to be the better long term prospect for the NBA level ... Played for the Dominican Republic National Men's Team, at age 16, coached by John Calipari, during the summer of 2012 ...

"Strengths: Has good size, strength, and an excellent frame ... Great length (nearly 7’4 wingspan) ... Very smooth player with good touch ... Improving conditioning ... Good physical tools ... Nice upper body strength ... High basketball IQ ... Knows when to cut to the basket and when to drift out to the perimeter for an open shot ... Does the little things well and hustles ... Fundamentally sound ... Sets solid screens for teammates ... Versatile and a do-it-all player ... Can score from numerous spots on the floor ... Smooth offensive game ...Very skilled player on offense ... Can score the ball in a multitude of ways from inside or outside ... Good (but not great) outside shooter ... Nice form on his jumper ... Capable of knocking down open 3-pointers and can space the floor ... High release point on jump shot ... Great spot up shooter and can pull up from mid-range ... At his best offensively when’s he’s in the post/paint ... Displays polished footwork, good body control, and a soft touch around the rim … Patient on offense ... Has a variety of post up and face up moves ... Can score with his back to the basket ... Possesses an effective spin move ... Able to finish at the rim through contact ... Can score with jump hooks and mid-range jumpers (15 to 18 feet from basket) ... Capable of scoring with both hands ... Savvy shot creator off the dribble/can put the ball on the floor ... Attacks the basket well when bigger/slower players are defending him on the perimeter ...Willing passer with good court vision and feel for the game ... Effective passer out of the post and out of dribble drive penetration ... Has shown that he could be a good ball handler and distributor from both forward spots ... Active and aggressively goes after defensive and offensive boards ... Can rebound in traffic ... Runs the floor will in transition ... His length allows him to bother shooters on the perimeter and force them into bad shots ... Can be versatile on the defensive end in terms of guarding more than one position ... Plays physical, tough, and is reliable and a hard worker ...

Weaknesses: Does not do one thing at an elite level ... Not a high flyer. A smooth athlete, but not very explosive ... Remains to be seen, but could potentially be relegated to a stretch 4 at the next level because of his lack of explosiveness ... Not especially quick, lacks speed ... Needs to improve his on-ball defense ... Does not possess great lateral quickness, which results in him getting beat off the bounce too often ... Struggles with defending quicker players ... Not overly athletic (for NBA’s standards) ... Inconsistent and struggles from the 3-point line (currently shooting 13 percent) ... Does not overmatch anyone on offense with the strength he has ... Needs to add more strength to his build and bulk up ... Slow-footed … Is not known for his shot blocking/rim protecting abilities … Does not have the abilities to be a good individual defender right now, especially in space ... Does not come up with many steals ... Average low post and perimeter defender ... Was asked to play as a 3 for much of the time, which played to his strengths as a face up scorer, but didn't help to improve upon his back to the basket skills ... 

Notes: Although he’s sometimes Kentucky’s forgotten man and most underrated player, NBA talent evaluators know the potential he possesses ... The former Mr. Indiana Basketball has an old man’s game, but would most certainly be racking up double-doubles for any other school that is not loaded with front court players like the Wildcats ... Lyles is gifted offensively, and is very productive as a post player even though he’s played out of position (at the 3 instead of the 4) for most of the year ... It may be easy to forget because he’s surrounded by so much size, but he is a 6-foot-10 235-pounder who can handle the ball, is a good passer, and can knock down shots from various spots on the floor, though he does not hit 3-pointers consistently yet ... His overall season averages do not jump out at you (8.7 points on 49 percent shooting, 5.4 rebounds and 1.1 assists), but he’s been a key part of Kentucky’s success despite not getting the national recognition as some of his teammates ... Ballooned in weight in the summer between his junior and senior seasons of high school ... "
"Strengths: Cauley-Stein is a player who is both extremely gifted from a measurements standpoint, but also in terms of athleticism ... At the Kentucky Combine he measured 7’.25’’ in shoes, with a 7’2’’ wingspan, and a great 9’2’’ standing reach ... He also is extremely nimble, and an explosive and quick leaper ... Willie also has tremendous defensive abilities, excelling at hedging on pick and rolls, as well as protecting the rim ... He’s seen a dip in shot blocking numbers due to his use as a pick and roll defender, and Karl Anthony Towns being used as the primary paint enforcer, but as a sophomore WCS blocked 2.9 shots per game as Kentucky’s primary rim protector ... His physical tools should allow these elite defensive traits to translate to the NBA level ... Cauley-Stein has the potential to be able to guard NBA wing positions at a high level, at least early in his NBA career ... He is also a strong finisher around the rim, and an ideal roll target in the NBA. His junior season at Kentucky he shot 72.5% at the rim, and he’s an active player on the offensive glass which helped him rack up 40 put backs in 38 games ... He had a number of highlight plays in which he went over and through defenders for highlight finishes at the rim ... Although not a major offensive threat, he has improved his free throw shooting every season starting from an anemic .372% as a freshman, to a significantly better .617% as a junior (granted 61% remains below average) ... This work has also shown up in his ability to knock down short jump shots in the half court game ... He also has a decent jump hook which could potentially be honed over time ... Cauley-Stein is also very productive in his time on the court ... Due to UK’s depth he played just 25.8 minutes per game, but his per 40 minute averages are 14.1 ppg 10 rpg 2.6 bpg and 1.8 spg ... 

Weaknesses: Willie is very much a defensive oriented player, and a guy who really doesn’t project into much of an offensive contributor ... His work at the free throw line has shown some promise, but he projects mostly as a lob finisher, roll target, and garbage man in an NBA offense ... His touch and shooting are a real weakness in terms of game speed ... He’s also had some ups and downs over his career in terms of focus ... For a player with such immense phyical gifts, it's baffling that he wasn't a more productive player early in his college career ... Feel for the game is a major question mark ... WCS has exhibited more poise, and fire as a junior, but he still has shown times in which he’s seemed a little passive or not 100% into the game ... WCS has the feel of an athlete who is becoming a basketball player, and while the intrigue with his defensive abilities is apparent, he remains a project for the NBA level ... Continued improvement and growth in terms of focus will be needed in order to play a long 82 game NBA season ... 

Overall: Willie Cauley-Stein is a player you can plug in your system in order to play high level defense, and provide both versatility guarding perimeter players and the ability to guard the rim ... His one side of the ball type of play will cause him to be drafted below players that have two way potential, but he has the ability to be very good, or possibly elite as a defender if he can harness his improved metal focus, and grow as a professional ...

Notes: Measured 7’.25’’ in shoes, with a 7’2’’ wingspan and a 9’2’’ standing reach while weighing in at 240 lbs at the Kentucky Combine. He also measured a 37’’ max vertical and a 12’3’’ max reach.

"Strengths: High basketball IQ and 3-point specialist ... Good feel for the game and makes smart plays ... Sharpshooter who’s shooting release and form is mechanically sound ... Silky-smooth and lighting quick release with a soft touch … Has good balance and accuracy on his shot and releases the ball at its highest point ... Nice body control when shooting jumpers and driving/finishing at the rim ... Efficient shooter from the 3-point line (shooting 40 percent on 3-pointers) ... Great floor spacer ... Terrific scoring instincts ... Can hit big shots ... Possesses a deadly step-back jumper ... Makes shots from the corners and at the top of the key ... Strong free throw shooter (shoots north of 80 percent) ... Can hit mid-range jumpers (shooting 52 percent on 2-pointers) ... Tremendous range ... Ability to catch-and-shoot and make shots off the dribble ... Efficient shooter off pick-and-rolls and while coming off screens ... Takes good shots ... High-volume shooter and scorer ... A crafty and instinctual playmaker who can distribute to his teammates ... Willing to make the extra pass around the perimeter ... Unselfish player and wants to get his teammates involved ... Decent ball skills and the ability to drive with either hand ... Makes up for his lack of speed with good ball fakes, jab steps and hesitation dribbles ... Comfortable with attacking closeouts ... Uses screens well to drive the ball ... Does not turn the ball over at a high rate ... Can finish at the rim with powerful dunks and adjust to finish at the basket ... An underrated athlete with surprising leaping ability ... Elevates well off the floor ... Has a decent crossover ... Moves well without the ball and makes timely cuts ... Can run the floor well in transition (sees the floor, makes good passes and can score) ... Effectively uses baseline screens to free himself up for shots ... When his shot is not falling, he shows up in other areas of the game whether it’s rebounding or defending ... At 6-foot-6, 206, he has good strength and size for a two-guard at the next level and resembles a prototypical high-volume NBA long range specialist ... He’s capable of using one or two dribbles and pulling up from 15-18 feet...Can defend and contain players on the perimeter by using his lateral movement ... Smart defender, gives good effort and puts pressure on the ball ... Is rarely out of position on defense ... Uses his hands well to come up with steals and disrupts shots ... Exhibits good closeout speed ... Overall, he’s confident and tough player with a high motor ... 

Weaknesses: Lack of an explosive first step makes it dificult to keep defenders from crowding him ... Not an amazing run/jump athlete or physical specimen ... Has a small body frame (wingspan) considering his height ... Gets to the rim and foul line sporadically ... Average ball-handler ... Has not shown great instincts passing out of dribble penetration ... Lacks the strength needed to defend quicker and more athletic players’ dribble penetration through contact ... Needs to get stronger ... Unable to fight well over the top of screens ... Puts his body on the driver as they get inside the arc, resulting in foul trouble ... Could be a bit more aggressive (but controlled) on the defensive end ... He’s not long, as his wingspan is an underwhelming 6’6 ¼ ... Lacks the length to effectively contest shots in the perimeter ... Does not have the highest vertical (35.5 inches) ... Needs to improve his foot speed ... Low steal and block rates ... Does not rebound as well as he should for his size ... Struggles to score on half-court drives ... Very unlikely to penetrate or even seek to penetrate all the way to the rim if the defense is pressuring him with the basketball ... Needs to work on his left hand ... Gets thrown off his game when opponents get physical with him ... Does not create much separation off the bounce … Sometimes fades away on his pull-up jumpers ... Takes contested shots off the dribble … Will have to continue to round out his game so that he can develop into a more complete player at the next level ...

Notes: Measured 6'5 (in shoes) 186 lbs, with a 6'6.5 wingspan at the 2012 LeBron James Skills Academy ... Measured 6'6 (in shoes) 194 lbs with a 6'7 wingspan at the 2013 Kevin Durant Skills Academy ... Booker has played the role of 3-point specialist on a high-powered Kentucky Wildcat team featuring size, athleticism, depth at all positions, and a host of future NBA players ... Arguably Kentucky’s most important perimeter player, it’s safe to say that the freshman is a part of the Wildcats long list of players who could be playing at the NBA level as early as next season ... Booker is Kentucky’s second-leading scorer (current average of 10.5 points per game) and 3-point shooter (40 percent). During conference play, he led the Wildcats in scoring at 12.0 points per game. The 6-foot-6, 206-pound, Mississippi native is as confident as they come on the basketball court. In a nutshell, he’s a quality shooter and scorer with a great understanding of the game and how to get his looks despite not being an elite-level athlete. By season’s end, the freshman shooting guard was selected as one of 10 finalists for the 2015 Wayman Tisdale Award, annually given by the United States Writers Basketball Association to the top freshman in college basketball. His game is often compared to NBA All-Star and Golden State Warriors forward Klay Thompson.

A crafty and instinctual playmaker who can distribute to his teammates ... Willing to make the extra pass around the perimeter ... Unselfish player and wants to get his teammates involved ... Decent ball skills and the ability to drive with either hand ... Makes up for his lack of speed with good ball fakes, jab steps and hesitation dribbles ... Comfortable with attacking closeouts ... Uses screens well to drive the ball ... Does not turn the ball over at a high rate ... Can finish at the rim with powerful dunks and adjust to finish at the basket ... An underrated athlete with surprising leaping ability ... Elevates well off the floor ... Has a decent crossover ... Moves well without the ball and makes timely cuts ... Can run the floor well in transition (sees the floor, makes good passes and can score) ... Effectively uses baseline screens to free himself up for shots ... When his shot is not falling, he shows up in other areas of the game whether it’s rebounding or defending ... At 6-foot-6, 206, he has good strength and size for a two-guard at the next level and resembles a prototypical high-volume NBA long range specialist ... He’s capable of using one or two dribbles and pulling up from 15-18 feet...Can defend and contain players on the perimeter by using his lateral movement ... Smart defender, gives good effort and puts pressure on the ball ... Is rarely out of position on defense ... Uses his hands well to come up with steals and disrupts shots ... Exhibits good closeout speed ... Overall, he’s confident and tough player with a high motor ... 

Weaknesses: Lack of an explosive first step makes it dificult to keep defenders from crowding him ... Not an amazing run/jump athlete or physical specimen ... Has a small body frame (wingspan) considering his height ... Gets to the rim and foul line sporadically ... Average ball-handler ... Has not shown great instincts passing out of dribble penetration ... Lacks the strength needed to defend quicker and more athletic players’ dribble penetration through contact ... Needs to get stronger ... Unable to fight well over the top of screens ... Puts his body on the driver as they get inside the arc, resulting in foul trouble ... Could be a bit more aggressive (but controlled) on the defensive end ... He’s not long, as his wingspan is an underwhelming 6’6 ¼ ... Lacks the length to effectively contest shots in the perimeter ... Does not have the highest vertical (35.5 inches) ... Needs to improve his foot speed ... Low steal and block rates ... Does not rebound as well as he should for his size ... Struggles to score on half-court drives ... Very unlikely to penetrate or even seek to penetrate all the way to the rim if the defense is pressuring him with the basketball ... Needs to work on his left hand ... Gets thrown off his game when opponents get physical with him ... Does not create much separation off the bounce … Sometimes fades away on his pull-up jumpers ... Takes contested shots off the dribble … Will have to continue to round out his game so that he can develop into a more complete player at the next level ...

Notes: Measured 6'5 (in shoes) 186 lbs, with a 6'6.5 wingspan at the 2012 LeBron James Skills Academy ... Measured 6'6 (in shoes) 194 lbs with a 6'7 wingspan at the 2013 Kevin Durant Skills Academy ... Booker has played the role of 3-point specialist on a high-powered Kentucky Wildcat team featuring size, athleticism, depth at all positions, and a host of future NBA players ... Arguably Kentucky’s most important perimeter player, it’s safe to say that the freshman is a part of the Wildcats long list of players who could be playing at the NBA level as early as next season ... Booker is Kentucky’s second-leading scorer (current average of 10.5 points per game) and 3-point shooter (40 percent). During conference play, he led the Wildcats in scoring at 12.0 points per game. The 6-foot-6, 206-pound, Mississippi native is as confident as they come on the basketball court. In a nutshell, he’s a quality shooter and scorer with a great understanding of the game and how to get his looks despite not being an elite-level athlete. By season’s end, the freshman shooting guard was selected as one of 10 finalists for the 2015 Wayman Tisdale Award, annually given by the United States Writers Basketball Association to the top freshman in college basketball. His game is often compared to NBA All-Star and Golden State Warriors forward Klay Thompson.

"Strengths: Center prospect with the size and skill set to make a strong impact at both ends of the floor in the NBA ... Hard worker, smart kid, with strength of character ... Shows desire and a competitive nature ... Possesses a great feel for the game ... Offensive game oozes potential with a text book shooting form, great touch and ability to hit outside and mid range jumpers effortlessly and consistently ... Has even implemented a steadily improving hook shot into his repertoire ... His length and strong body gives him excellent ability to rebound and hold position in the post ... Tremendous rebounder on a per 40 minute basis, with big hands, good box out fundamentals, post positioning and energy ... Has worked hard on his body and has developed broad shoulders and good strength ... Should be able to add additional weight and play comfortably in the 260-270 range ... Shows a willingness to play physical and fight in the post ... Terrific passer, good vision, he's able to find players when doubled, and even have the offense run through him at the high post ... Very good shot blocker. Though not a huge leaper, has excellent timing and shows the ability to use his great length as a rim protector ... Shows better speed than quickness, and can really motor once he gets a head of steam ... Hustles and shows the willingness to defend and play hard ... Underrated foot speed and perimeter defensive ability ... Doesn't seem to get winded easily, though the UK platoon system helps in this area ... Has shown the ability to defend players much smaller than himself with success on the perimeter ... 

Weaknesses: Has struggled mightily with his post offense early in the season. Post play, foot work and confidence on the block needs a lot of work ... Still appears to be growing into his body, movements are gangly ... A very solid athlete, but not the most explosive leaper without momentum, though he's shown the ability to dunk from the free throw line, so he's not exactly a plodder ... Second jump leaping not a strong point ... Appears to leap better off of one foot than two which is better for wing players ... Huge feet seem to weigh him down some and challenge his ability to make quick moves from a standstill position ... Has shown a tendency to get in foul trouble and the current ""platoon system"" at Kentucky does not allow scouts to accurately judge his ability to play full games and stay out of foul trouble ... Has a lot less pressure to produce on a daily basis on a stacked UK team. It's easy to look good when teams are not able to focus all of their attention on a player the caliber of Towns. Coach Calipari's system also does an excellent job of showcasing a player's strengths while masking their weaknesses ... Top heavy. Despite showing a huge set of arms and shoulders, his lower body strength needs work, as he gets knocked off balance and pushed around at times. Balance can improve. Granted, considering his age and work ethic, these are not hugely concerning issues ... 

Notes: Measured 6'11.5 (in shoes) 235 lbs, with a 7'3.5 wingspan at the 2013 Nike Big Man Skills Academy ... One of three prospects in the 2015 draft (along with Mudiay and Okafor) with franchise potential ... Just scratching the surface of his abilities, and appears to have a lot of upside left to develop ... Mother hails from Dominican Republic ... Less polished and proven than Duke center Jahlil Okafor , but we view him to be the better long term prospect for the NBA level ... Played for the Dominican Republic National Men's Team, at age 16, coached by John Calipari, during the summer of 2012 ...

"Strengths: Has good size, strength, and an excellent frame ... Great length (nearly 7’4 wingspan) ... Very smooth player with good touch ... Improving conditioning ... Good physical tools ... Nice upper body strength ... High basketball IQ ... Knows when to cut to the basket and when to drift out to the perimeter for an open shot ... Does the little things well and hustles ... Fundamentally sound ... Sets solid screens for teammates ... Versatile and a do-it-all player ... Can score from numerous spots on the floor ... Smooth offensive game ...Very skilled player on offense ... Can score the ball in a multitude of ways from inside or outside ... Good (but not great) outside shooter ... Nice form on his jumper ... Capable of knocking down open 3-pointers and can space the floor ... High release point on jump shot ... Great spot up shooter and can pull up from mid-range ... At his best offensively when’s he’s in the post/paint ... Displays polished footwork, good body control, and a soft touch around the rim … Patient on offense ... Has a variety of post up and face up moves ... Can score with his back to the basket ... Possesses an effective spin move ... Able to finish at the rim through contact ... Can score with jump hooks and mid-range jumpers (15 to 18 feet from basket) ... Capable of scoring with both hands ... Savvy shot creator off the dribble/can put the ball on the floor ... Attacks the basket well when bigger/slower players are defending him on the perimeter ...Willing passer with good court vision and feel for the game ... Effective passer out of the post and out of dribble drive penetration ... Has shown that he could be a good ball handler and distributor from both forward spots ... Active and aggressively goes after defensive and offensive boards ... Can rebound in traffic ... Runs the floor will in transition ... His length allows him to bother shooters on the perimeter and force them into bad shots ... Can be versatile on the defensive end in terms of guarding more than one position ... Plays physical, tough, and is reliable and a hard worker ...

Weaknesses: Does not do one thing at an elite level ... Not a high flyer. A smooth athlete, but not very explosive ... Remains to be seen, but could potentially be relegated to a stretch 4 at the next level because of his lack of explosiveness ... Not especially quick, lacks speed ... Needs to improve his on-ball defense ... Does not possess great lateral quickness, which results in him getting beat off the bounce too often ... Struggles with defending quicker players ... Not overly athletic (for NBA’s standards) ... Inconsistent and struggles from the 3-point line (currently shooting 13 percent) ... Does not overmatch anyone on offense with the strength he has ... Needs to add more strength to his build and bulk up ... Slow-footed … Is not known for his shot blocking/rim protecting abilities … Does not have the abilities to be a good individual defender right now, especially in space ... Does not come up with many steals ... Average low post and perimeter defender ... Was asked to play as a 3 for much of the time, which played to his strengths as a face up scorer, but didn't help to improve upon his back to the basket skills ... 

Notes: Although he’s sometimes Kentucky’s forgotten man and most underrated player, NBA talent evaluators know the potential he possesses ... The former Mr. Indiana Basketball has an old man’s game, but would most certainly be racking up double-doubles for any other school that is not loaded with front court players like the Wildcats ... Lyles is gifted offensively, and is very productive as a post player even though he’s played out of position (at the 3 instead of the 4) for most of the year ... It may be easy to forget because he’s surrounded by so much size, but he is a 6-foot-10 235-pounder who can handle the ball, is a good passer, and can knock down shots from various spots on the floor, though he does not hit 3-pointers consistently yet ... His overall season averages do not jump out at you (8.7 points on 49 percent shooting, 5.4 rebounds and 1.1 assists), but he’s been a key part of Kentucky’s success despite not getting the national recognition as some of his teammates ... Ballooned in weight in the summer between his junior and senior seasons of high school ... "
"Strengths: Cauley-Stein is a player who is both extremely gifted from a measurements standpoint, but also in terms of athleticism ... At the Kentucky Combine he measured 7’.25’’ in shoes, with a 7’2’’ wingspan, and a great 9’2’’ standing reach ... He also is extremely nimble, and an explosive and quick leaper ... Willie also has tremendous defensive abilities, excelling at hedging on pick and rolls, as well as protecting the rim ... He’s seen a dip in shot blocking numbers due to his use as a pick and roll defender, and Karl Anthony Towns being used as the primary paint enforcer, but as a sophomore WCS blocked 2.9 shots per game as Kentucky’s primary rim protector ... His physical tools should allow these elite defensive traits to translate to the NBA level ... Cauley-Stein has the potential to be able to guard NBA wing positions at a high level, at least early in his NBA career ... He is also a strong finisher around the rim, and an ideal roll target in the NBA. His junior season at Kentucky he shot 72.5% at the rim, and he’s an active player on the offensive glass which helped him rack up 40 put backs in 38 games ... He had a number of highlight plays in which he went over and through defenders for highlight finishes at the rim ... Although not a major offensive threat, he has improved his free throw shooting every season starting from an anemic .372% as a freshman, to a significantly better .617% as a junior (granted 61% remains below average) ... This work has also shown up in his ability to knock down short jump shots in the half court game ... He also has a decent jump hook which could potentially be honed over time ... Cauley-Stein is also very productive in his time on the court ... Due to UK’s depth he played just 25.8 minutes per game, but his per 40 minute averages are 14.1 ppg 10 rpg 2.6 bpg and 1.8 spg ... 

Weaknesses: Willie is very much a defensive oriented player, and a guy who really doesn’t project into much of an offensive contributor ... His work at the free throw line has shown some promise, but he projects mostly as a lob finisher, roll target, and garbage man in an NBA offense ... His touch and shooting are a real weakness in terms of game speed ... He’s also had some ups and downs over his career in terms of focus ... For a player with such immense phyical gifts, it's baffling that he wasn't a more productive player early in his college career ... Feel for the game is a major question mark ... WCS has exhibited more poise, and fire as a junior, but he still has shown times in which he’s seemed a little passive or not 100% into the game ... WCS has the feel of an athlete who is becoming a basketball player, and while the intrigue with his defensive abilities is apparent, he remains a project for the NBA level ... Continued improvement and growth in terms of focus will be needed in order to play a long 82 game NBA season ... 

Overall: Willie Cauley-Stein is a player you can plug in your system in order to play high level defense, and provide both versatility guarding perimeter players and the ability to guard the rim ... His one side of the ball type of play will cause him to be drafted below players that have two way potential, but he has the ability to be very good, or possibly elite as a defender if he can harness his improved metal focus, and grow as a professional ...

Notes: Measured 7’.25’’ in shoes, with a 7’2’’ wingspan and a 9’2’’ standing reach while weighing in at 240 lbs at the Kentucky Combine. He also measured a 37’’ max vertical and a 12’3’’ max reach. SEC All-Defensive Team 2013,14,15. 2015 SEC Defensive Player of the Year. 2015 First Team All-American.
