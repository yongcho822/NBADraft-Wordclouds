"Strengths: Off the charts run/jump athleticism … Lateral quickness and length also gives him great potential as a perimeter defender, along with versatility to guard both wing positions efficiently … Incredibly dangerous in transition opportunities, long strider with a quick first step, did a great job of scoring or getting fouled when getting out in transition … Shooting mechanics have improved greatly, with quickness enough to get his shot off under tight defense … Got to the FT stripe at a good rate, making 77.5% of his attempts … As an offensive rebounder, can keep possessions alive that very few others can due to his second jump and tremendous leaping ability … Challenged defensively at Kansas, often asked to guard the other teams leading scorer on the wing, doing an admirable job … Unselfish, will look for teammates and is an evolving playmaker … Spin move can become a major weapon in isolation, plus has shown a floater that over time could become a weapon … When being closely defended, his step back jumper has also been a move that is tough to guard … Plays with a quiet intensity and while some question his lack of emotion, also never gets to down … When he has been challenged, has shown an ability to step up to the challenge … Son of a former NBA player and an Olympic sprinter, has an understanding of the game and a knowledge of where to get to on the court … Conditioning is fantastic, played major minutes as a freshman and should be able to carry a solid work load immediately … Ability to run the floor is elite and ensures a certain level of success at NBA level … Very skinny but has the broad shoulders to add weight if he's determined to ... Showed an increased understanding of his role and got much lower on defense as the year progressed at Kansas, looks to be quite coachable ... Aside from a poor final tournament game, seemed to be playing his best basketball as the season came to a close, including a huge 40 plus point breakout performance against West Virginia ... 

Weaknesses: The biggest issue is whether or not Wiggins has the mental make up to maximize his immense physical gifts. While some scouts are extremely high on him, there are just as many that question his focus and passion for the game ... Often plays too upright on offense, which can get him off his base and lead to turnovers … Needs to work on moving without the ball, has a reputation of sometimes standing, ball watching … Defensive awareness is something he must work on, along with always running out to his spot and not relying completely on length, athleticism to challenge a player … Still needs to add upper body strength, had issues finishing around the basket and getting knocked off of his spot when defensive rebounding … Long range shot is still not overly consistent, sometimes turns his hand outward on follow through … Often loose with dribble, sometimes has the ball too high and gets exploited when double teamed … Some question his lack of assertiveness offensively, which calls into question his ability to be a primary option on a high level team … Battled inconsistency and struggled against physical defense, which could point to strength as well as a sign of shaky confidence … Should look to become a more vocal leader ... Too often settled for long range shots and did not venture out of his comfort zone enough, still has many things to learn in terms of creating mid range shots and counter moves … Had a difficult time establishing post position, something that could be a crucial next step to utilize his quickness and size as a wing at the next level ... Has been compared to Kobe Bryant, but the biggest difference appears to be the attention to detail. So far, granted Kobe's is extremely rare, Wiggins has been lacking in this area. Will he develop this critical aspect in order to polish his all around game to achieve greatness? 

Notes: Hype and expectations were enormous for his freshmen season, and he finished as a consensus 2nd Team All-American with averages of 17.1 ppg and 5.9 rpg … Even through ups and downs during his short time at Kansas, he showed glimpses of having exceptional potential as an NBA wing player … Born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, Wiggins has done very well when representing Canada in International competitions, going 2-0 as part of the World Team in the Nike Hoop Summit, averaging 18.5 ppg and 8 rpg … Shows enough athleticism and versatility to possibly play both wing positions, could become a match-up nightmare … The sky is the limit for him, as he's been blessed with the type of athleticism that does not come along in every class. Considered by some as the best athlete to surface in 10 years, since LeBron James. Will he develop the work ethic to maximize those abilities is the question … A virtual lock as a top 3 pick with a chance to go first depending on who gets the selection ..."
"Strengths: He has an astonishing combination of size, physical skills, length and speed ... He’s already well developed from the muscular standpoint, especially in the upper body, with long arms and strong hands ... His solid body structure allows him to effectively withstand contact, and to attack the basket without struggles even at senior level, plus he has shown the ability to exploit his size by posting up smaller and weaker opponents ... He has remarkable passing skills and ball handling abilities … He tends to switch to the PG position on offense, exploiting his ability to beat his direct defender to create for himself and his teammates ... He loves to attack the basket in ISO situations, exploiting his physical skills and his speed, with a slashing style of game ... He plays with energy and intensity giving an effective contribution in various aspects of the game, he’s also a good rebounder for his position ... On the defensive side he puts great pressure exploiting his body and quick hands. 

Weaknesses: His shooting is the biggest flaw and a point of concern, even if he has shown significant improvements since last year, especially from three point ... His mechanics in particular needs several adjustments, both from a quickness and release standpoint ... His game comprehension and playmaking skills are still rather raw, bad decision making leads to frequent turnovers, especially when put under pressure by his defender ... At the youth level his game was based on physical domination, but with the increase in level of opponents, his effectiveness has significantly decreased ... On the defensive side he has terrific potential, but he’s not consistent and he lacks the fundamentals of positioning in a structured system ... As highlighted by Michael Visenberg during the Hoop Summit, his focus and attitude are a red flag, which limit his consistency during games ... His bad body language and poor determination could really limit his appeal, despite he possessing first round talent.

Notes: Measured 6-8.5 in shoes, 240 lbs, 7'3 wingspan, and a 8'11.5 standing reach at the 201Nike Hoop Summit ... A French Guyana native, Inglis grew up from the basketball standpoint playing with INSEP, being included in all French junior National teams. He has been one of the top performers during 2013 NIJT tournaments in Belgrade and London. This summer he signed a contract with the ProA team of Roanne, where he’s averaging 4.6 points and 3.6 rebounds (49% from the field, 38.7% from three points). He was in the roster of world team during 2014 hoop summit (4 points and 4 rebounds in 15 minutes on the court).

"Strengths: Parker is on another level from his peers, skill wise ... Very strong, bulky forward with elite level face up game for his age ... An underrated athlete; Parker plays a smooth, if not overpowering brand of ball, and is more likely to muscle through opponents than blow by them ... Possesses very good hands ... Shows the ability to grasp nuances of the game ... Has a passion for basketball, and this comes out in his play ... A la Paul Pierce, is especially good at step back jumper, and can do it in both directions ... Creates a ton of separation with his step back ... Can go to work in the post, especially against smaller and weaker defenders ... Will likely be developed as a small forward in the NBA, where he will immediately become one of the largest and strongest at this position ... Work ethic is phenomenal ... Really wants to be a leader; wants to be great ... Even in high school, practiced with the focus of a pro ... Has been a winner every step of the way of his career; won four straight Illinois State Titles in high school ... Can create for teammates thanks to his high basketball IQ and overall play making ability ... Commands so much attention from opposing defenses that teammates will find themselves with more opportunities to receive the ball in a position to score with him on the floor ... Can finish with both hands around the hoop ... Solid, but not great ability to knock down the NBA 3-ball ... Had some impressive dunks in his freshman season at Duke, which proved that he does possess the hops and explosiveness that he often does not get credit for ... Also showed surprising body control and ball handling, weaving through defenders for finishes at the rim in the open floor ... 

Weaknesses: Defense and position are the two biggest questions with Parker ... Some wonder whether he is quick enough to guard on the perimeter, or if he is long enough to defend the post ... Has been given the ""tweener"" label that no draft prospect wants associated with his name ... Appears to carry some extra ""baby fat"" ... Somewhat slow release on the jumper, and it has a hitch; may need to tweak release to improve scoring opportunities against athletic defenders who match his size ... Can he expand his range to be a reliable 3-point shooter? ... Was asked to play in the post defensively for Duke, which may lead to an even bigger learning curve for Parker as he improves his understanding of how to guard wings in the NBA ... Not a particularly crafty defender; surprising given how intelligent an offensive player he is ...

Notes: A Mormon, and has not yet done a Mormon mission ... Had considered delaying his college career to do the mission, but obviously opted to play ball ... Some conspiracy theorists wonder if he gets drafted by a team that he does not want to play for, whether he threatens to hold out on signing a contract and instead go on a mission. But this is definitely more speculative than a likely scenario at this point ... Did not participate in the 2014 Draft Combine, given that he is already a consensus top 3 pick ... Is an elite talent, and has been considered as such since his early high-school days ... USBWA National Freshman of the Year award winner for his stellar 2013-14 campaign as a Duke Blue Devil ... Had a successful freshman season at Duke, although the team disappointed in the NCAA Tournament, losing to 14 seed Mercer in the first round ...

"Strengths: KJ is obviously an outstanding athlete; he can jump really easily off two feet or of one without any difference. In the last year he finally used this gift to become one of the best rebounders in his conference while only 6’6 ... He is particularly dangerous on the offensive glass, where if he doesn’t have a body on him he knows how to get the crowd involved with spectacular tip dunks ... Transition is another area where he shines, both as a ball handler or runner on the wing, when he has the ball and there is nobody in his lane he goes strong to the basket, very often making the right decision ... When he is off the ball in transition he's often catching lobs and alley-oops ... This part of his game will really stand out in the NBA, particularly for teams with good PGs and that like to push the ball in transition ... He also added to his game a respectable 3 point jumper, not very pretty to see but definately to be respected ... He has very good percentages with his feet set ... Despite the offensive reasons the real gem of McDaniels game for NBA scouts is his defense ... He has outstanding efficiency numbers defending the ISO according to Synergy and he can guard 1-2-3 without any problems due to his length and quickness ... He his very good of the ball as well, reading screens and situations. Thanks to his feet being in constant movement, he is really hard to post up, and this allowed Clemson to play him as a “4” in a small lineup. He is not by any mean an offensive threat but was still able to average more than 17ppg which could allow any NBA coach looking for a new “Tony Allen” to play him without risking to play 4 on 5 on the offensive hand

Weaknesses: His biggest weakness right now is still his offensive game ... His shot is getting better, particularly his 3 pointer with his feet set, but when defenders run him off the line he has a very poor pull up shooting and his decision making is highly questionable ... Needs to develop a mid-range game and learn how to finish around the rim ... Right now when he gets to the rim but can’t dunk, he struggles to finish, especially with his left hand ... Seems to suffer a lot when defenders get into his body, which raises some questions about his attitude to fight and be strong durin a physical game ... He will never need to be a great scorer, but needs to be consistent enough where he can punish the defense with open shots and precise cuts ... Ball handling also needs some work, his one on one often finish with a turnover as McDaniels often struggles to read the help ... Defensively he needs to embrace the role that will be for him in the NBA, get stronger to defend stronger players, but all those are just natural developments that will occur in his career ... Overall he will definitely have to struggle to find his spot in the League but without any doubt he could be the guy many coaches and GM are looking for to add athleticism and a defensive stopper on a good team ...

Rick Fois 5/3/14

Strengths: You can’t talk about McDaniels without bringing up his ridiculous athletic ability … Really is a trampoline in the open floor and shows electric speed and leaping skills around the rim … A highlight waiting to happen … Looks the part of an NBA wing, standing a true 6’6 200 lbs with a wiry strong build…More than adequate length for either wing position…Likes to dunk the ball…Could very well be the most explosive athlete in the 2014 class…Runs the floor very well…Pretty reactive player who plays a livewire style and should an above average nose for the ball…Really good offensive rebounder, and shows the ability to soar over defenders for dunks around the rim…Attacks the rim pretty well with his ability to go in straight lines…Is a reasonable shooter out to 22 ft and is able to hit open jump shots with decency, but is still a work in progress…Gets to the foul line at an impressive rate and is a very good shooter when there (5.4 ftpg at 84% as a Jr)…His free throw percentage is encouraging for teams hoping he can continue to improve his jumper in the future…Willing rebounder who understands where to be on the glass…Clearly an elite shot-blocker for a wing prospect, averaging almost 3 blocks a night as a Jr…Has the potential to defend either wing spot and has all the athletic tools to be an effective defender in the NBA as well…A late blooming prospect who began to legitimately open eyes in the NIT, but had a breakout season after making good improvement in each of his 3 years at Clemson…Has some experience playing PF, and has an adequate post game for a projected wing player…Made impressive improvements to his game every year in college, and got better in every statistical category from his Soph. to Jr. season…Plays the style of game that could make him an intriguing fan favorite in the right system 

Weaknesses: McDaniels is still a fairly raw prospect, and will need to improve his perimeter skills to be a truly effective offensive player in the NBA … Has mediocre at best ability to create his own shot off the dribble…Can let the ball slow him down, and is significantly less effective the more his dribbles …Though he’s an improved shooter, he is still a below average all around shooter…Has a bit of a slow release and doesn’t have the softest touch…Generally needs time and space to be at his best shooting jumpers…Still seems to be learning how to think the game naturally, sometimes isn’t as aware as he should be on both ends of the floor…Not likely to pass the ball alot … Doesn’t show a great feel for the game … Not the type of player that needs to be featured offensively at the next level ...

Overall: McDaniels has a lot of the physical tools needed to be a good NBA role player and fan favorite … Is an explosive athlete, with nice size and pretty good playing energy … Shouldn't require a lot of touches to be effective at the next level, and he looks the part of a potentially tough defender … Was the ACC Defensive Player of the Year and also a shot-blocking demon as a perimeter player and inside the arc … Needs to continue to work on his perimeter game as a whole, but his improvements have been extremely promising … Seems like he could go anywhere from the late-1st rd to the mid-2nd round in 2014"
"Strengths: The sculpted Embiid has a prototypical body for an NBA center, standing 7 feet tall, with a 7.5-foot reach, and weighing 250 pounds. He could use more muscle, but his frame should have no trouble bearing the additional bulk … Posted outstanding per-40-minutes numbers in his lone season at Kansas, averaging 19.4 points, 14 rebounds, and 4.5 blocks … An agile and mobile center, with nimble feet, good speed, great quickness, and vertical explosiveness … Excellent around the rim, scoring regularly on put-backs and alley opps. According to Hoop-Math.com, Embiid made 76.3 percent of his attempts at the rim this past season… His offensive game is still a work in progress, but the potential is there. His offensive arsenal includes very quick drop-steps, jump hooks, and turn-around jumpers … Uses a variety of ball and body fakes to create space for his shot, including the renowned “Dream Shake.” … Draws a bunch of fouls (8.8 per 40 minutes), and makes a respectable 69 percent of his free-throw attempts … An active and aggressive weak-side defender … Covers a lot of ground with his length and huge strides … Stats don’t tell the full story – on the defensive end, he alters a number of shots and is generally disruptive … Not timid – willing to put a body on someone and mix it up in the paint … Sets solid screens … Doesn’t panic when double teamed … 

Weaknesses: Embiid had trouble staying on the floor, either due to injuries or foul trouble. In a total of 28 games at KU, he played fewer than 20 minutes 10 times and more than 30 minutes only three times … Questionable durability – this past season, he missed one game (Feb. 15) due to a knee injury, played in the four following games, and then was shut down for the rest of the year due to a stress fracture in his lower back. He also dealt with lower back issues as a senior in high school … Averaged a whopping 5.9 fouls per 40 minutes at KU … Lacks both offensive and defensive awareness … Averaged 4.2 turnovers per 40 minutes at KU … Defensively, he frequently focuses too much on the ball and loses track of his man … Was at times pushed off the block by bigger centers … Seems to get frustrated when not heavily involved in the offense or not making his shots. At those times, his play appears to be a bit lackadaisical …

Notes: Was named to the 2013-14 Associated Press All-America Second Team and also named the Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year … Set the KU freshman record with 72 blocked shots. Also set KU freshman records in field goal percentage (62.6) and rebounds per game (8.1) … Finished second in the Big 12 in blocks (2.6 per game) and sixth in rebounds per game ... Was not tested much in the undersized Big 12 conference, and when he was, the results were relatively subpar. In a total of five games vs. the big front lines of Texas, Baylor and New Mexico, plus one game against the muscular Patrick Young and Florida, Embiid shot 50 percent from the field and averaged 10.3 points, 6.7 rebounds, 2.8 blocks, and 24 minutes per game … Began playing basketball at one of Luc Richard Mbah a Moute’s basketball camps in Cameroon when he was 16 years old … Speaks three languages: English, French, and Bassa (the native language of Cameroon)…

Outlook: The optimist looks at Embiid and thinks of his outstanding per-40 stats, while the pessimist thinks about the fact that he missed 20 percent of Jayhawks’ games and averaged less the 24 minutes per outing when he was out there. The optimist thinks about Embiid’s skill level despite his lack of experience and drools over what he could become in 3-4 years, while the pessimist worries that Embiid has just as much of a chance to become the next Greg Oden as he does the next Hakeem Olajuwon … Almost no one expects Embiid to fall further than third overall in the draft. Exactly where he is selected will come down to his private workouts and medical examinations. He worked out for Cleveland last week, and the subsequent media reports were conflicting to say the least. It is fairly safe to say that the Cavs didn’t promise to take Embiid with the first overall selection because he is headed to Milwaukee later this week ... As for the Sixers, who hold the third overall pick, Embiid is not currently to scheduled to meet with them, or if he is, it has not yet been reported ... 

Richard Harris 6/17/14"
"Strengths: One the better three-point shooters in the draft, Harris finished his four-year college career second all-time in 3-point percentage (40.7%) and 3-pointers (263) at Virginia… His forte is the catch-and-shoot – he moves tirelessly without the ball, using screens and misdirection to get open… While he is by no means an isolation player, Harris does have a solid handle and effectively uses ball fakes, step-backs, crossovers, and hesitations to create space for his shot or go to the hole... Not overly flashy, but is a very effective passer – anticipates well and quickly delivers to the open man. Averaged 3.2 assists per 40 minutes as a senior at UVA… Not an elite athlete, but is a fairly sticky defender – always has one eye on his man and the other eye on the ball, anticipates well (again), and avoids being picked off by screens by taking proper angles… Tough and durable – broke a bone in his left hand vs. North Carolina (2/11/12) and played the rest of that game and the last eight games of that season with protection on the hand. Also, ranks first all-time at Virginia in games played (135)… Has great intangibles – awareness, unselfishness, fortitude, and leadership…

Weaknesses: Harris has below-average speed and struggles with faster opponents on both ends of the floor… Disappears at times, offensively – because he relies heavily on off-the-ball movement to get open and is adverse to taking potentially contested outside shots, he can be neutralized by a sticky man-to-man defender or good team defense… Not vertically explosive and has a short wingspan (6’6’’), and as a result, does not excel as a rebounder, a shot blocker, and a finisher… Made a subpar 56.3 percent of his shots at the rim this past season, according to HoopMath.com… Struggled from the free-throw line as a senior, making just 64 percent of his attempts. It was the second straight season that his FT percentage dropped. He made a career-high 77.2% as a sophomore… 

Notes: A key member of a Virginia squad that won both the ACC regular-season championship and the ACC tournament in 2013-14… Named ACC Tournament Most Valuable Player last season… Had his best season as a junior, averaging a career-high 16.3 points, 4.0 rebounds and 2.2 assists per game… Made 41.7 percent (65-156) of his three-point attempts in 2010-11, the best by an ACC freshman since 2000… At the NBA Combine, he performed as expected. He was average to below-average in the athletic drills, but was one of the top shooters at the event, making 80 percent of his 2-point jumpers and 64 percent of his 3-pointers…

Outlook: Harris is a heady player, who shoots well, plays solid defense, and hustles. Unfortunately, his below-average athletic ability greatly limits his potential. His intangibles will likely pique the interest of NBA teams, and he could be a role player in the right system, such as the Spurs’ motion offense… If he is not drafted, he should find a job in Europe, where his unselfishness and shooting/passing skills would serve him very well.

Richard Harris 6/23/14"
"Strengths: A very athletic and versatile PF … Is a very active and energetic type of athlete, showing great leaping ability and explosiveness … Plays with a high motor… Physically lean, but is a wiry strong player who doesn’t shy away from contact … Shows a very good nose for the ball … Always must be accounted for on box outs, as he is a very good offensive rebounder and shows an outstanding 1st and 2nd jump … High IQ player, who plays to his strengths and generally makes quick and precise decisions … Is an excellent passer for a guy who is generally considered a PF prospect (2 apg as a Fr.), and is a good decision maker as well … Moves well without the ball around the rim, and makes himself available for easy buckets … An alley-oop magnet with huge suction cup hands …Usually finishes with authority … Has a good enough 1st step to sporadically create his own shot on straight line drives to his right … Impressive defensive skills … Defended some at every position while at Arizona, and generally was excellent considering his relative inexperience ... Contests every jump shot and is very disciplined on closeouts … Adequate shot-blocker … Understands the concept of help side defense better than a typical young player, which should allow him to play minutes immediately in the NBA … Very focused ... An extremely well-conditioned athlete, who rarely gets tired or makes “lazy” plays … Seems like a great glue guy and role player, and isn’t the type of player who needs a lot of plays run for him to be effective … Will fit in well on a team in need to energy and athleticism … Pretty competitive player who doesn’t show a lack of effort often, which will always please his coaches … Still extremely young, won’t turn 19 until about a month or so before the 2014-2015 season ..."
""
"Strengths: The 18-year-old Aussie is a fluid and versatile athlete, who shows a great deal of potential … Good size for a guard, and should fill out nicely over time … Excels at getting to the basket and drawing fouls … Finishes through contact and can score with either hand … Excellent body control allows him to make very acrobatic shots at the rim … Opposing defenders are constantly off-balance due to his effective hesitation moves and explosive first step … Moves well without the ball – makes good use of screens and does it at a relatively high rate of speed … Can create scoring opportunities for both himself and his teammates … Just scratching the surface in certain areas of his game – effective at making floaters, shooting off the step-back and posting up, but does not use these skills very often … Improving as an outside shooter – smooth and elevates well off the dribble … Very versatile – used at the 1, 2, and 3 spots … An active and alert team defender – his length and speed allows him to cover a lot of ground … Comes up with a lot of steals and loose balls … Does a little bit of everything, and is willing to do whatever is needed to win, including setting screens and mixing it up in the paint … A good kid – is coachable, affable, grounded, humble, and intelligent ...

Weaknesses: Level of competition is the biggest knock against Exum. He has not proven himself against a high enough level of competition to make anyone feel completely comfortable drafting him in the top 5 ... Some of his best performances have come in games (Under 19 World Championships) where he appeared to be one of the most physically advanced players ... Playing for the Australian National Team, he was given free reign to create offense for himself. Can he be as succesful without being given the same level of freedom? ... Exum has played off the ball a lot, and he doesn’t appear ready to be a true point guard … His handle is loose at times – has the ball poked away too often and occasionally fumbles when changing hands or directions … Not an exceptional facilitator – makes too many ill-advised passes … Inconsistent outside shot – does not always get enough elevation and has a low release point, especially when his feet are set (catch-and-shoot) … Trajectory on his shot appears flat at times ... Settles for long-distance threes too often … Not vertically explosive and struggles to finish with authority. For a player who thrives off of beating defenders off the dribble, his lack of ability to explode and finish with the best of them is concerning … Tends to drive to the left and shoot with his right … Struggles at the free-throw line, shooting around 65% in International competitions ... Can he develop his body and become a tough player capable of finishing with contact? 

Notes: Exum’s father played on UNC’s 1982 national championship team with Michael Jordan … Attended the Australian Institute of Sport, an elite high school for gifted athletes, which has produced NBA players such as Andrew Bogut and Patty Mills … At 15, Exum became the youngest player to ever be on the Australian national team. The head coach of that squad at the time was Brett Brown, the current coach of the 76ers … Exum was named to the All-Tournament Team at both the U–17 and U–19 World Championships in 2012 and 2013, respectively … Led Australia to the semifinals in the 2013 U–19 World Championships. In 9 games, he averaged 18.2 points, 3.8 assists, and 1.7 steals per contest… Played for the international select team at the 2013 Nike Hoop Summit. Helped his team to a victory over a US squad led by Jabari Parker and Julius Randle, with 16 points, 3 rebounds, 2 assists, 2 steals, and one block … Displayed his speed, quickness, and agility at the NBA Combine in the lane agility (2nd overall), shuttle (6th overall), and sprint (8th overall) drills. 

Outlook: We have seen enough of Exum to know that he is one of the best under-20 players in the world, but he still has quite a ways to go before becoming a star in the NBA… The areas that he needs to focus on are his ball-handling, decision-making, and outside shooting, especially if he wants to reach his goal of being a Derek Rose-like point guard… The potential is there, so much so, that he will likely be drafted ahead of a number of players who are more NBA-ready.

"Strengths: Stokes is a powerful power forward who is a load to stop on the low block … Great at establishing position around the basket, which is reflected by his 53% shooting from the field this past season … Great rebounder for his size; averaged 10.6 RPG last season … Plays with a high motor and crashes the boards/boxes out tenaciously … Plays with a high IQ and has a good team-first attitude for a guy trying to make it in the league … Great touch around the rim. Very efficient finisher in the post …Very difficult player to back down in the post … Gets to the line a fair amount. Averaged over 6 free throw attempts per game this season, where he connected at a rate of 70% … Rarely has an ""off night"". Recorded 22 double-doubles this year … Gets up and down the floor quickly in transition …Decent jumper from out to mid-range … With a 7'1"" wingspan, Stokes has fantastic length … Good at using a few quick dribbles to get around his man in the paint … Great hands … Has gotten more comfortable playing away from the basket this season on both ends of the court…"
"Strengths: Strong, heady point guard with great size and instincts…Uses his mixture of quickness, strength, instincts, and aggressiveness to get to the rim, then uses his big frame and excellent body control to finish through contact…In addition to his scoring ability, Smart doubles as an excellent passer and playmaker. He has great court vision and is willing to make the unselfish play to set up his teammates. Averaged 5.8 assists per 40 minutes last season...Very sound perimeter defender who has the length (6'8"" wingspan), the strength, and the lateral quickness to keep his man in front of him. Plays hard and harasses ball handlers into making bad decisions…Draws multiple defenders on his drives, then has the alertness to kick it out to an open teammate for a 3…Ball-hawking defender who averaged around 3 SPG throughout his college career. Once again, his big wingspan helps him terrorize the passing lanes...His aggression and power allow him to get to the line at an excellent rate. Shot over 8 free throws per game last season in just over 32 MPG…Great rebounding point guard due to his size and strength. Averaged nearly 6 rebound a game last season…His height and his strength also allow him to post up smaller point guards and finish inside...Loves to get out in transition and has the vision and finishing ability to make him elite at running the fast break…Can play with guard position and can also defend multiple positions due to his size/quickness combo…Has a nose for the ball. Will dive on the floor to get loose balls and will rip it out of the offensive player's hands from time to time...Shows flashes of greatness in the pick-and-roll as both a scorer and a passer…Outside shot can be effective when Smart is on his game, making him a great inside-outside weapon...Makes winning plays. His decision-making is excellent and he is great at balancing setting up teammates and making a scoring play himself…Raised his PPG (18.0 to 19.9) nearly 2 points per game in games against ranked opponents last season...Great motor and energy. Puts it all on the line every minute of every game and always plays with intensity and competitiveness…Has that other-worldliness, always-in-control, do-what-it-takes-to-win, elite factor that a select few point guards (Kemba Walker, Trey Burke) in recent drafts have exhibited…"
"Strengths: Light on his feet and solidly built, the 6-foot-9, 257-pound O’Bryant looks the part of an NBA power forward … A versatile interior scorer, O’Bryant improved his scoring average and shooting percentage in each of his three seasons at LSU … A triple-threat offensively – can score off the drive, in the post, or from midrange with his jumper. Uses a variety of impressive spin moves in the post, can make hook shots and layups with either hand, and has a midrange fade-away that is difficult to defend … The range on his jump shot extends past 22 feet, though he is far more reliable inside 15 feet … According to Hoop-Math.com, O’Bryant made 69 percent of his shots at the rim and 40 percent of his two-point jumpers this past season, both above-average numbers … Effectively uses his sturdy body – not easily moved in the post, not fazed by contact, and draws a good number of fouls (7.3 FTA per 40 minutes this past season) … Has active hands and a nose for the ball … Sets solid screens … A solid rebounder, especially on the offensive end of the floor … Motivated, involved, coachable, and levelheaded … Showed steady physical and mental improvement throughout his career at LSU … Transformed his body between sophomore and junior seasons and is moving much better with the new, svelte body ... Appears to have the length and strength to play both PF and center at the NBA level ... 

Weaknesses: Turnover prone – averaged 4.3 turnovers per 40 minutes this past season … Often reacts too slowly to double teams, and throws errant passes or travels as a result … Doesn’t have an explosive first step, and has trouble beating his man off the dribble … Sometimes overestimates his dribble/drive skills and finds himself with no place to go with the ball, with the end result being a turnover or a forced shot … Does not block many shots, not so much because he’s vertically challenged but because he is not aggressive in terms of challenging shots… Not overly physical on either end of the floor, and sometimes falls in love with his finesse game on the offensive end… Has below-average speed and doesn’t score much in transition … Can finish with authority, but doesn’t do it as often as he should … Not a great foul shooter, making fewer than 64 percent of his attempts … Conditioning could be better – needs to convert some of his baby fat into muscle … Playing at the 5 spot in college, he is not a tested perimeter defender…

Notes: Measured 6'9 (with shoes) 260 lbs with a 7'1.5 wingspan at the 2013 Nike Big Man Skills Academy ... As a junior at LSU, O’Bryant was the focal point of the offense, seemingly touching the ball on every possession. When he was not on the floor, the Tigers’ offense frequently struggled … This past season, he shot 49.6 percent from the floor, averaged 15.4 points and 7.7 rebounds per game, and was named to the All-SEC First-Team for the second straight season … One of just 14 players in LSU history to finish his career with more than 1,000 points and 700 rebounds … In three games against Kentucky’s vaunted frontline this past season, he averaged 22.3 points and 9.3 rebounds per contest … Was not overly impressive at the NBA Combine, finishing near the bottom in both the shuttle (3.32) and sprint (3.45) drills, and registering one of the higher body fat percentages (10.75%). On the plus side, he posted solid vertical numbers – 31 inches standing and 35.5 inches with a running start … According to his agent, Gerald Collier, O’Bryant has worked out for Atlanta, Phoenix, San Antonio, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, and Minnesota. He is scheduled to work out for Houston, Miami, Charlotte, Milwaukee, Memphis, Toronto, Detroit and possibly one more team ...

Outlook: O’Bryant has the potential to become a very effective scoring PF at the NBA level. Unlike many of the other big men in this draft, he can score both inside and out … His weaknesses are correctable, and he has been focusing on improving in these areas this offseason. His explosiveness, both vertically and horizontally, could simply be improved by continuing to increase his conditioning and by adding more muscle. To become an outstanding offensive player, he also needs to tighten his handle, make better decisions, and improve his shooting consistency beyond 15 feet ... On the other end of the floor, it’s unlikely that he will ever play at an elite level – he’s not tall enough to consistently defend pro centers, and he’s not quick enough to reliably stay with agile power forwards on the perimeter … O’Bryant appears to be a lock to be drafted at least in the second round, and if he impresses in his private workouts, he has an outside chance to be taken at the end of the first round ..."
"Strengths: Long and fast small forward with a good outside stroke … Has a 7'+ wingspan, adding to his potential as a defender and rebounder … Versatile swingman who can take the ball inside, shoot from deep, and capitalize on mismatches against smaller or slower defenders … Effective from close range with the right-handed floater/hook … Can shoot the three ball. Shot 42% from distance last season on a high volume of outside shots … A bit unconventional with his post game, but he's able to get a fair amount of buckets inside … Great transition player due to his good speed and his ability to fill the lane … In the last stretch of organized games he played, Daniels was magnificent as he teamed with Shabazz Napier to lead the Huskies to the National Championship. Averaged 16 PPG and over 7 RPG in six games on the biggest of stages, the NCAA tournament … High efficiency scorer who posted percentages of 47%-42%-79% … Good ball handler at his size … At 1.4 BPG, Daniels is a good at giving help with rim protection. His timing and length help him turn away his fair share of shots and even chase down guys going for breakaway layups … Has a high, hard-to-defend shot release … Good lateral quickness, which combines with his length to give him lots of defensive potential … As a secondary scorer to Napier and sometimes Ryan Boatright, Daniels showed his willingness to play a complementary role ... Plays hard. Brings the right attitude to the court ...

Weaknesses: What makes him versatile can also make him a ""tweener"". He's rail-thin and may lack the size to defend larger forwards, but may still be developing perimeter abilities, although these are less of a concern … Concerning defensive technique. Can be too upright in his defensive stance, negating his natural defensive abilities … Had 11 single-digit scoring outputs this past season, which is indicative of his inconsistency and occasional lack of assertiveness on offense … Doesn't really do any one thing on an elite level offensively, instead bringing together a full complement of above-average skills … NBA-sized defenders will limit his unrefined post game and contest his high release on the perimeter in a way that college defenders generally did not … Doesn't create for his teammates. Aceraged a mere 0.4 assists per game last season in 29 minutes per game ...

Overall: Daniels has a bevy of physical tools that he has just recently begun to put together on a consistent basis, in addition to a solid outside touch and he showed the world his abilities during UConn's championship run. He's still a little raw and very thin, but his versatility and length should get him plenty of first round looks…"
"Strengths: Pure shooter with a picture perfect stroke and excellent range (44% career 3 point shooter) ... Gets his feet set quickly and gets solid elevation on his jumper. Long arms also help him to get his shot off ... Crafty, cerebral player who maximizes his athletic ability. Good at making adjustments during plays ... Fiery competitor. Appears to lack a conscience and does not shy away from the limelight ... Very smooth offensive game. Shows the ability to spot up for shots, as well as get shots off the dribble and has shown a solid ability to hit shots without much daylight ... Improved considerably from FR to SO season. To his credit has worked hard to expand his game beyond just shooting, becoming a solid pick and role facilitator, even running the point during stretches in his sophomore year ... Surprising leaper off of two feet and if he gets an open lane to the basket, uses his excellent length for some exciting two handed finishes at the rim ... Ball handling is good for 2 guard ... Has embraced the role of go to scorer and become the #1 option for Michigan this season ... Solid a/to ratio shows good decision making and ball protection ... Could fill the role of a 3 point shooting specialist, a la Steve Kerr, if his shot remains as effective from NBA 3 ..."
"Strengths: Dinwiddie is a dual offensive threat, who averaged 18.9 points and 4.1 assists per 40 minutes over his last two seasons at Colorado … Dangerous in transition – glides down the floor and slithers his way to the basket … Smooth. Good body control and great touch on his floaters … Uses nifty hop and Euro steps to get to the rim… Draws a bunch of fouls, averaging 9 FTA per 40 over his last two seasons at CU … Excellent free-throw shooter, making better than 81 percent of his attempts in each of his three seasons at CU … Solid three-point shooter, making more than 41 percent of his attempts in two of his three seasons with the Buffalos … Very effective scoring and finding open perimeter shooters when driving off the pick and roll … Tallest player classified as a point guard at the combine – his height allows him to shoot unimpeded and easily find open teammates … Makes crisp interior passes … Good off-the-ball defense – denies very well … Fast – gets down the floor quickly and can stick with talented scorers, such as Marcus Smart and Andrew Wiggins, on defense … High character guy with good intelligence. Seemingly a good teammate – enthusiastic, likable, expressive, involved, and shares the ball …

Weaknesses: Dinwiddie's most glaring weakness is his lack of assertiveness and consistency. Scouts often wonder why his level of intensity is not at the same level at all time. Should look to be a little more selfish (assertive). Has standout ability but doesn't always take it upon himself to be the star that he should be ... Still recovering from a torn ACL that he suffered in January … Questionable whether he is a true point guard or more a combo – frequently played off the ball at CU, though excels in ball handling and passing … Slender build – bounces off stronger players on both ends of the floor … Avoids contact when driving – prefers to pull up or pass out rather than go all the way to the hole … Limited dribble moves … Doesn’t show much ability to create his own shot, frequently relying of screens to get open … Too dependent on his right hand – shoots with his right on drives to the left side of the rim… Easily picked off by screens on the defensive side of the ball, which is seemingly due to a combination of a lack of awareness and strength ...

Notes: At the time of Dinwiddie’s knee injury, CU was 14-2 and ranked 15th in the country. At the time, he was averaging 14.7 points and 3.8 assists per game and shooting 46.6 percent from the field and 41.3 percent from the 3-point line ... Without him, the Buffalos were a sub-500 team, losing 10 of 19 games … In all-time school history, he ranks third in free throw percentage (.830) and fourth in 3-point field goal percentage (.386) … Confident and engaging, Dinwiddie is the self-proclaimed “Mayor,” and a fan favorite. Received the most votes by the fans at Pachoops.com for having the best moustache in the conference …

Outlook:  Assuming that he can regain his past form, Dinwiddie should be a solid NBA player ... Would fit well alongside an undersized scorer like Monta Ellis ... He relies heavily on screens to get shots, is not an especially gifted ball handler, is a little too upright and stiff to defend smaller, quicker guards, and perhaps most importantly, spent a great deal of time playing off the ball in college… If he wasn’t coming off a serious knee injury, Dinwiddie would be a good bet to be drafted late in the first round, but now, he appears destined to go somewhere in the second… 

Richard Harris 5/25/14"
"Strengths: Ideal PF size with very long arms and the skill set that had many envisioning him as a wing while in high school … Has shown flashes of potential to stretch the defense, as well as a rapidly developing post game, helped by his solid frame … Will not be 19 until August, which again brings to mind the potential growth his body and game could go through, along with the fantastic size and coordination he already possesses … Was a great rebounder during his freshman season, very aggressive on both ends of the floor hitting the glass … Gets out on the break and runs very well for his size. Shows very good mobility for a player with his size and strength, moves his feet especially well considering his thick, tree trunk legs ... His combination of length, size and mobility made him a factor on that side of the floor, along with having major upside on that end with increased experience, awareness … Showed a good shot selection, shot a high percentage from the field and line, even showing ability out to three point range that could be developed down the line … Surprising ability to put the ball on the floor with decent mobility, along with range that should have defenders respecting his shot … Gets to the line fairly often and shot 71.3% FT as a freshman … Definitely passionate about basketball, has shown a will to improve and put in work … Cerebral kid. Is described as a gym rat, constantly looking to add to his game and made definite strides from senior year of HS to his freshman year of college … Though he is not an elite leaper, his length makes him a shot blocking and shot changing force ..."
"Strengths: A very athletic forward prospect with top notch physical tools … Projects to be a wing, and has good size for the position at 6’8, and possesses outstanding length to match (7’2 3/4 wingspan) and a massive 8'11"" standing reach … Has a good frame to add weight without the loss of athleticism, and should be an amply sized wing as he inevitably gets bigger … Runs the floor exceptionally well, and is a long strider with good speed and high level leaping skills … Gets off the floor quickly … Covers tons of ground every times he moves … His size and athleticism could allow him to be a Swiss army knife on the defensive end of the floor, as his length and lateral quickness are both tantalizing for a forward … Was pretty good and sound as a defender in the back of Cuse’s 2-3 zone, which bodes well for teams who wanted a clearer read on his ability to adjust to traditional NBA style defense … Nice pick and roll player … Is a good finisher around the rim and gets a high number of dunks … Able to “get skinny” around the rim to finish around defenders … Has some effective finger rolls and scoop shots … Is tough to stop from getting to the rim off the bounce from the foul line …Will be a hard cover for PF’s because of his quickness and ability to attack off the bounce inside the arc…Is generally effective without having many plays run through him … Moves well without the ball and is adept at cutting to the basket for easy baskets … Good offensive rebounder and will get put back dunks if the defense doesn’t box him out … Plays with energy and a good motor, and is willing to put his body on the line for loose balls … Got to the foul line at an extremely impressive rate last season, which speaks to his aggressive nature as a slasher … Has considerable potential as a player, and his ability to continually improve will be largely based on simply putting on pounds which shouldn’t be that hard for him to do … Was on Team USA’s U19 World Championship team this past summer (put didn’t participate in the actual game due to mono), and was applauded for his defensive efforts in practice sessions…Has promise, and will not be 21 years old until near the end of next season … Has relatively limited wear and tear, as he only played extended minutes this past season at Syracuse ...

Weaknesses: He could have some struggles to find a true position, especially initially in the NBA … Obviously needs to put on weight, and even though he has since HS it has been a fairly slow process and improving his thin body will have an impact on his NBA career … His perimeter skills are a bit underdeveloped, and he shows below average handles and a nonexistent jumper from deep … Pretty predictable off the dribble, and very rarely goes left … No good from anywhere outside of 12 feet as a shooter, and he made 0 3 pointers as a Soph. ... Has an awkward release that needs to be overhauled completely … Though he has real good defensive potential and put together some strong defensive performances in college and the World Championships, adjusting his instincts from Boeheim’s 2-3 zone to a largely man to man system will likely take a little time … Showed some raw instincts at times on defense in college …Was not nearly the type of shot-blocker or playmaker on defense his physical tools suggest he should’ve been this past season (0.6 bpg and 0.8 spg) … Reliant on teammates to produce offensively and generally is ineffective when his guards struggle, which happened often down the stretch for Syracuse … Has virtually no post game for a guy who played extended time at the PF spot and projects to play some minutes at PF at the next level in small-ball lineups …Rarely passes the ball … Still is a pretty green player, and has some learning to do before he reaches his potential as a player ...

Overall: Grant developed beautifully after a fairly underwhelming Fr. Season … He’s a tough matchup due to his size and athleticism as a forward … He’s a high energy player who could contribute in a number of ways on both ends as he develops … He should look to improve his perimeter skills, add strength and weight, and adjust defensively to be his best as a player, but he has plenty of time and potential to do so in the future … Grant is likely a 1st round pick in the 2014 draft ...

"Strengths: Tall, quick and talented offensive point guard ... Deadly first step and killer crossover allow him to get to the basket seemingly at will ... At 6'3"", has ideal size for a point guard ... Quick hands and great defensive instincts allow him to get a ton of steals. Has averaged 2.4 per game over the past 2 seasons ... Great in transition. Good finisher at the rim ...Very athletic, is able to play above for highlight finishes ... Good defender who shows a lot of defensive potential with his length (6'7"" wingspan) and quickness (lateral speed) ... Effective pull-up jumper, though needs to add range and consistency ... Seems to raise his game against good competition, as he did at the USA U19 tryouts and with his 20 points and 7 steals against Keith Appling and Michigan State last season ... Improving court vision ... Strong rebounding point guard ... Gets to the line at a good rate (9.5 attempts per game) ... Though a junior, he's a year young for his grade giving him added intrigue ..."
"Strengths: Tremendously athletic small forward who plays with a lot of energy … A great above-the-rim offensive player, Robinson is on the receiving end of many a lob pass … Ambidextrous. Can drive either direction with either hand ... Finishes strong at the basket, as well ... Good NBA body, standing 6'6"" with a solid frame and a 6'9"" wingspan ... Good at probing the defense for holes and finding a driving lane to the basket ... Runs the floor well and can be a terror in transition ... Good lateral quickness and long arms makes him a solid perimeter defender ... Attacks the offensive glass and scores on a number of putbacks and second-chance tip-ins ... Has great defensive instincts which, along with his long arms, allow him to jump the passing lane and take the ball the other way for an easy finish ... Solid shooter from midrange. Shot 49% overall, which is a testament to his efficiency and patience on offense ... Doesn't force things on offense, but when he chooses to attack, he does it with aggression and commitment ... Good free throw shooter. Shot 76% this season. Appears to be a better shooter than his numbers showed based on his form and shooting in practices ... Played for a pair of Michigan teams that made deep runs in the tournament …

Weaknesses: Can sometimes be too passive on offense ... Often seemed content to play a secondary role to Nik Stauskas and Mitch McGary (and even Caris LaVert) while at Michigan ... Decent, but not great outside shooter ... Needs to gain consistency to shoot from behind the arc at an NBA level ... Doesn't always get his feet set when shooting from distance ... Shot 31% from 3 this season. An unexpectedly low number considering his shooting ability ... Robinson is still maturing as a player. He's only 20 years old and often has the mental lapses or losses of concentration that come with that ... For being such a tenacious offensive rebounder, Robinson doesn't exert the same effort on the defensive glass. Averaged only 3 defensive boards per game this season ... Often needs others to set him up to score … Should look to tighten loose handle. Needs to protect the ball better when it's in his hands ... Can often get overmatched and bullied by bigger forwards, both on the perimeter and inside, but doesn't have the quickness to play the 2 ... Has a poor rate of drawing fouls. Averaged little more than 3 free throw attempts per game this season ... Sometimes he just needs to focus more on making the fundamentally sound play than the game-changing/highlight play ... Didn't quite make the level of improvements he was expected to make after his freshman year, though he certainly did show development ...

Notes: Son of former Bucks All-Star Glenn Robinson ... Measured 6'6.5 (in shoes) 211 lbs, with a 6'9 wingspan at the 2013 Kevin Durant Skills Academy…

Overall: Robinson has the physical tools and the general attitude to succeed in the NBA and he's still continuing to fine-tune his basketball skills ... Robinson has a great deal of potential and has shown in his college career that he's perfectly fine being a role player, but he needs to improve as a shooter and a defender …

Jacob Stallard 4/25/14"
"Strengths: Unbelievable scoring skills … Is aided by his outstanding shooting touch and “easy” shooting stroke … Deep range as a shooter … Has a textbook form to his shot, and squares his shoulders to the basket almost instantaneous when he attempts jumpers … Shows a very quick release and has the ability to quicken his release against closeouts … Has great footwork … Able to hit shots from deep with his feet set and off screens, and is also extremely effective with pull-ups … Polished mid-range player … Has a nice array of subtle moves he uses to give himself space from defenders closing out on him … Good fadeaway shot … Likes to shoot the Dirk-esque 1 foot fall away jumper, and is very effective at doing so … A coaches son who plays with a high IQ, and shows very good savvy and feel for the game … Very efficient player, was a career 50-40 player from the field and 3 respectively … Makes good decisions when moving without the ball, and did a good job getting easy baskets off cuts to the hoop … Rarely seems to press for his shots … Willing to make hustle plays … Plays a fairly tricky game that makes him a tough matchup to contain offensively … Good amount of floaters and runners in his arsenal … Slashes to the rim with a low center of gravity … Pretty strong … Though he is stuck between the forward positions, his post game could work to his advantage fairly often depending on matchups … Runs the floor better than most would think, and will run-out for easy baskets at the rim after missed shots … A good “trailerman” shooter in transition … Was one of 2 players (the other was Marcus Smart) invited to the Team USA mini-camp in 2013, and reportedly fared well enough to encourage scouts about his ability to translate to the NBA … Really good free throw shooter … Generally decent rebounder … Uses his body and the rim effectively to shield shot blockers when finishing around the rim … Improved his ability to create off the dribble substantially throughout his college career … Has some post game too, showing a good jump hook with his right … Tough to ignore his consistent dominance scoring the ball throughout his entire career at Creighton, despite his other limitations ... More athletic than he appears as he showed with a 36.5 max vertical at the NBA combine ... 

Weaknesses: McDermott’s athletic and physical limitations place questions about how he will translate to the NBA … Is not a very explosive or quick player, with average leaping skills … Is a tweener due to his lack of height, and his 6’6 ¼ height measurement without shoes in the combine did little to help his cause about answering questions about his ability to spend time playing the PF position at the next level … Lacks athleticism for the SF position, and not tall or long enough to play consistently at PF … Will have to rely heavily on timing and positioning to be effective at the next level … Gets his shot blocked quite a bit around the rim, and becomes much less effective the longer he has the ball in the post … Hard to imagine him getting daylight like he did at Creighton on his some of his shot attempts considering his fairly pedestrian physical skills and athleticism … How effective he becomes will depend directly on the system he goes to and exactly how his coach plans to use him based on game-to-game matchups … Had his share of struggles vs teams with true NBA athleticism in his college career … Has some weaknesses against long and athletic defenders … Can be rebounded and shot over a bit too often … Makes no impact whatsoever on the defensive end of the ball … Has posted alarmingly low steal and block numbers throughout his career for a projected frontcourt player, and that does not figure to improve at all in the NBA … Will his coaches ever look past the fact that he is a fringe defender? ... Doesn’t pass the ball often ...

Overall: Answered the ciritcs who claimed his success was due in part to playing in a small conference after putting up the same numbers in the Big East as a senior ... Comes off an unbelievable Senior season in which he cemented his legacy and became the 5th leading scorer in college basketball history … McDermott's productivity and scoring/shooting ability cannot be ignored when projecting him to the next level … Extremely fierce competitor, and had one of the best individual careers in college basketball history … He is able to get his shots off in more than a few ways, and likely will be a good per-minute scorer at the next level sooner or later … He proved to be a student of the game in his 4 seasons at Creighton, and improved nicely every season he was in school which is extremely encouraging … His physical and athletic limitations make him a player who needs to be utilized in certain ways to be succesful … His draft range is anywhere from the late lottery to the mid-first round ...

"Strengths: Very high basketball IQ, This is his greatest strength. Strong personality. A team player. Has a great work ethic ... Tremendous length ... Can really shoot the ball ... Hard worker ... He was first introduced to real professional training – strength and conditioning as well as basketball workouts in September of 2013 and has shown tremendous improvement in his body ... Possesses a big wingpan ... Considering the fact that he competes in the Adriatic league, where most players are older than he is, and also that he's an average athlete, he uses his basketball IQ to succeed... Nikola understands the game really well. Furthermore he is able to follow and execute coach’s instructions. Shows a winning attitude, competes hard in games and practices ... A self starter, doesn't need to constantly be pushed to get the most of his abilties ... Well liked by teammates, outgoing, strong character, doesn't drink or smoke ... Young player, born in February of 1995 ... 

Weaknesses: An average athlete lacking great speed and leaping ability ... Foot speed is a big liability. He may struggle to stay in front of NBA athletes at the center position ... Needs to improve as a post player, gain strength and develop a repertoire of back to the basket moves ... Defense is a real weakness at this point due to lack of lateral speed and lack of strength. His length is a big plus, but he'll need to continue to work on becoming stronger and learn to anticipate in order to overcome his lack of quickness ... Despite being a younger guy, his upside appears limited by his lack of explosiveness and foot speed ... 

Notes: Impressed at the 2014 Nike Hoop Summit with his outside shooting ... 

Stevan Petrovic 6/22/14"
"Strength: At 6’10 it is very hard to find anyone in the world with the skills he possesses to play with or without the ball anywhere on the court ... He can push it in transition as well as posting up with good results ... His feel for the game is what really separates him from many other “Point forwards” ... In Europe he can easily play as a 3 or 4 thanks to his court vision and decision making, very rare for a player of his height ... Perhaps his 2nd greatest strength is his aggressiveness on the boards ... He really is able to capture rebounds and quickly transform those rebounds in transition opportunity directly pushing the ball or making accurate outlet passes to teammates ... Another really underrated quality of Saric is his IQ and understanding of spacing, on both ends of the floor. His development as a point guard early in his basketball career have given him a tremendous feel for the game ... He is able to overcome his lack of athleticism many times being in the right spot in the right moment ... Obviously his versatility is attractive to scouts, as he seems to have many ways to impact games, not having to rely on one skill ... While his shooting mechanics need work, his percentages are much higher with his feet set ... His determination and basketball IQ are really what makes him such an attractive prospect, and the hope will be that he can overcome his limitations through desire, hard work and dedication ..."
"Strengths: A pretty good athlete with a strong build, nice body control, and adequate length … Is a powerful leaper off of 2 feet … Is a pretty smart basketball player and has textbook fundamentals in nearly every aspect of his game … Has a compact jump shot that he can hit with good regularity from as far as 25 ft. out … Explodes and elevates beautifully into his shots … Strong open court player … Can finish powerfully above the rim, and is a gliding type leaper who seemingly hangs in the air … Good first step … Moves well without the basketball … Unselfish player … Effective scorer in pick and roll situations … Does a good job of using his shoulders and hips to separate the ball from defenders on his slashes … Likes to shoot pull-up jumpers … Has the tools to be able to play spot minutes at PG at the next level, and is an acceptable passer on the wing … Not afraid to draw contact, and gets to the foul line at a reasonable rate … Pretty good on-ball defender … Plays with good energy and fought through screens well in college … Shows active hands as well … Improved nicely every season he was at Arizona and became a unanimous 1st Team All-American as a Jr., really showed a more polished game this past season ...

Weaknesses: Johnson is a 6’2 combo guard, and really didn’t get a chance to show much as a floor general to ease concerns about him being more of a 2 than a 1 as a Jr … He is pretty short for a true SG, and only has average length to compensate … Size makes him a liability guarding bigger wings ...Doesn’t really have a true standout skill on offense right now … Not going to show much creativity as a ball-handler, and can be prone to blindly dribbling into bad spots on the court … Although he is a high rising leaper, he never really excelled finishing around the rim in college; likely due to his lack of height … Can be shot over by taller wings … His jump shot, while decent, is not great and he settles too often … Will have to find an exact fit to really be at his best in the league, one who will live with his lack of height at the SG spot and is comfortable enough to let him run the offense sporadically as well ...

Overall: The reigning Pac 12 Player of the Year, Johnson leaves Arizona after a very strong Jr. season and his NBA draft stock as high as it has ever been … Johnson is an experienced player and he made very good strides every year he was in school … He’s a very good athlete and a decent offensive talent, and he offers very tough defense as well…His lack of height and perceived lack of a true position don’t help his stock, but he was a productive player and an All-American performer with some translatable skills ...

"Strengths: Blessed with truly high level explosiveness, LaVine was one of the most intriguing prospects in college basketball last season … Shows electric speed and quickness, and is certainly one of the best leapers in the 2014 draft class … Really good body control as well … Pretty long … His upside as a prospect has a way of jumping out of the TV screen when you watch him play … Plays an exciting and fairly flashy style, and is a highlight reel dunker in the transition game … Is a magnet for run-outs, as his speed and acceleration allows him to generally be one of the first players down the floor after missed shots … Has a sweet looking jump shot, and his range extends past the NBA 3-point line … Also blessed with a swift (yet unorthodox) release and a strong ability to create space to get his shots off … Able to hit shots off of screens or off the dribble, making him a guy who must be accounted for no matter what on the perimeter … More than adequate ball-handling ability … Will be a tough cover due to his athleticism and shooting skills, as he can slash when crowded or stop and pop if the defender gives him space … Gets great elevation and has a high release giving him a great ability to get shots off ... Has the ability to put up points in bunches … Already garnered experience playing as an instant offense threat off the bench in his lone year at UCLA, and that role will likely benefit him at the NBA level, as he gains experience … Would likely be most effective playing in an up-tempo system … Some think LaVine could develop into a combo guard at the next level, and he has the physical and athletic tools to do so … Shows finesse as a player, and is extremely fluid and smooth … A late blooming prospect, who wasn’t a highly touted recruit until midway through his Sr. season of high school … Could really just be scratching the surface of his true ability ...

Weaknesses: LaVine needs to develop more consistency and improve his basketball IQ … Has a tendency to settle for too many pull up jump shots and doesn’t attack the basket nearly as much as he should off the dribble … Got to the foul line at a poor rate for someone with his shot creating potential last season (1.8 FTA per night on 69%) … Pretty thin and frail, needs to put on more weight … Not a physical player at all, and really struggles with any aspect of the game dealing with contact right now … Has a raw feel for the game, and decides to take some bad shots at times … Though he’s projected by many to be a combo guard, LaVine didn’t show a great ability to handle double teams and struggled some when pressured … Is a pretty underwhelming defensive player, and will have a tough time finding consistent minutes on an NBA team until he shows more effort and strength on this end … Doesn’t seem to be a very tough player. Body strength will obviously help his ability to play through contact … Though he has good shooting skills, his jumper faded badly down the stretch last season and rendered him pretty ineffective throughout the month of March … Struggles mightily to contribute when his jumper isn’t falling … Is a very promising prospect, but will need time to develop overall before he’s ready to play consistently in the NBA ...

Overall: LaVine is another one of the Seattle-bred players who shows an intriguing skill set and will find himself playing in the NBA next season … His elite level, explosive athletic ability makes him an eye-opening player, and his jump shot and upside add more fuel to the fire … He needs to gain weight, polish and develop a better understanding of the game, but overall LaVine is a pretty impressive prospect who will only be 19 when he is selected in the draft … Drafting LaVine is a little bit like taking a player out of high school. He will require patience, but few in this draft have as much long term potential ... Look for him to be a certain 1st round pick , with a chance to jump up into the lottery ...

"Strengths: Standing 7-3, with an astonishing wingspan of 7-9 he has tremendous size, combined with excellent mobility for a big man with his dimensions ... He’s always active on the floor, showing great progresses from a conditioning standpoint, compared to when he arrived on the Canary Islands ... Offensively he’s really effective in pick and roll situations, showing the ability to finish above the rim after the cut with aggressiveness, furthermore his mobility and coordination make him an effective contributor in creating space for his teammates with solid screens, playing a key role in Gran Canarias offense .. Most of his offensive repertoire is based on dunks and put backs after an offensive rebound, but he has shown significant improvements on his hook shot using his right hand ... He has a soft touch and he’s a solid free throw shooter ... Defensively he’s a great pick and roll defender, being able to recover in the painted area after helping on the screen ... Plus with his great size and wingspan he’s definitely a great rim protector. According to those with knowledge of him, he’s a nice, humble guy with a great work ethic ..."
"Strengths: Warren is a big time scorer and a guy with fantastic instincts for the game ... He works very hard on both ends of the floor and has a knack for finding openings in the defense to put the ball in the hoop, in other words, he’s very opportunistic ... This ties in with his offensive rebounding as well, he always seems to be in the right position ... He’s excellent in transition and runs the floor extremely well ... Works well both on and off the ball ... He can spot up and knock down jumpers from deep, he can set up his man and beat them via backdoor cuts or he can create for himself ... He has range from all over the floor, although he’s best from midrange, and is surprisingly comfortable handling the ball ... Lost some weight and looks more athletic this year ... Will overpower lesser athletes around the basket playing bully ball ... He is becoming more of a wing from a skill standpoint ... Defensively he puts forth a great effort, and rebounds very well."
"Strengths: Outstanding athlete with incredible leaping ability (43.5” 2-step vert at the Combine) … Is a pretty swift runner with good start/stop ability … Should come with a warning label, ""Highly Explosive"" … Was a mainstay on highlight reels because of his dunking ability, and was one of the very best dunkers in college basketball last year … A threat on backdoor alley-oops or transition and is explosive enough to finish over trees … Long arms … Has developed a nice jump shot too, and has extended his range to about 25 ft (38% from 3) … Showed steady improvement in his shot (FG, FT and 3p), and all around efficiency throughout college career ... Can spot up and shoot from range, and is comfortable shooting off screens from mid-range too … Decent pull-up jumper … Explodes into his shot and shows pretty consistent mechanics … Can score in bunches … Played in a college system that had good floor spacing, and looked increasingly comfortable finding ways to get open moving without the ball, especially in his last 2 seasons at Oklahoma State … Solid attacking the basket in a straight-line; shows a good 1st step … Strong enough to deal with contact and get shots up around the hoop … Usually a good finisher … Fairly aggressive player … Pretty good on-ball defense, and blocked shots exceptionally well for an undersized SG (1 bpg as a Sr.) … Has the physical and athletic tools to defend PG’s and small 2’s … Plays with a low center of gravity with the ball in his hands … Feisty and competitive … Makes an impact on the glass … Underrated passing ability and isn’t really a selfish player (near 2-1 a/to ratio) … Scouts liked how he looked when asked to run the team when star PG Marcus Smart got suspended for 3 games in the Big 12 Conference Slate, and some think he may have the potential to play spot minutes at PG eventually ... Kept a consistent, steady demeanor despite playing amongst what appeared to be a ""dysfunctional family"" ... 

Weaknesses: Brown is a 6’4 SG, making size one of the main detriments to his pro prospects, though his 6'9 wingspan and 8'4 standing reach are both very good … Not a great ball-handler, and can struggle to create for himself when his 1st step doesn’t get him past his matchup … His lack of ball handling is a huge detriment as it limits his ability to utilize his great athletic gifts. He's also not a good enough jump shooter, currently, to be counted on as a NBA 3 point shooter ... Sometimes is forced to settle, and will fall in love with shooting jump shots at times … Though he got a chance to play some PG last season, he doesn’t have the natural instincts for making players better, needed to really be considered a combo guard … Might struggle to defend more physically gifted SG’s in the NBA … Though he continuously improved his shooting throughout his college career, he will need to maintain consistency to further enhance his chances of sticking as an NBA player ... Can be a step late on defense, and should improve his off-ball awareness … A bit reliant on teammates to create opportunities for him ... May need some time to become a contributor, despite being a senior ... 

Overall: Brown’s outstanding leaping ability and jump shooting are his main calling cards as a prospect at the moment … He enjoyed a standout 4-year career at Oklahoma State, developing into a steady, all-conference performer in a pretty tough league his last 2 years and made big strides in his shooting ability … His ball-handling needs work and his lack of size does him no favors … Brown ceiling is as a late 1st round selection in the 2014 draft ...

"Strengths: An explosive big with shooting range to the college 3-point line ... Shot a very impressive 42.3% on 3.4 3-point attempts per game as a college senior ... Payne should be a quality ""pick and pop"" option in the NBA because of his toughness and shooting stroke ... Very good free throw shooter (about 80% in his final two seasons at MSU) ... He comes off as being a bit stiff in his movements, but is as explosive off 2 feet as they come ... A banger on the block. Has decent post moves and a good stroke ... Improving feel around the basket and in the post, especially when it comes to making a counter move and passing out of double teams ... Known to be an ""intangibles"" guy who is a good leader and hard worker ... Physical. Has toughness you'd expect from an Izzo coached player ... Wiry strong -- entered MSU with a slender frame but has filled out well ... Appears to be the type of player that is even stronger than he looks ... Really showed off his athleticism in the college dunk contest, where many agree he had the most impressive dunk of the event, doing a 360 while bringing the ball down to his feet mid-air before throwing it down with authority."
"Strengths: Mobile and highly coordinated big man with an all-purpose skill set. Measured in at 6’11 (with shoes) at the NBA combine, and has added 20+ lbs. of muscle since arriving on campus a string bean … 6.2% body fat … Powell remains a free and easy mover despite upgrades to his frame … He hovers, no clunking … Fluid gait … Runs the floor productively with well above average end to end speed ... He was Stanford’s most reliable playmaker/facilitator by a wide margin as a senior (3.1 assists). Excellent distributor, surveying the action and possesses a natural guard feel … Basketball IQ is a considerable checkmark in his favor … Face up 4-man – quickness and ball handling variety … Jump shot stroke looks pure in the mid-range and collegiate three-pointer was not foreign to his repertoire (46% as junior, 14 total makes) … 80% free throw shooter in 2012-2013 … Projection as pick-and-pop threat is entirely foreseeable … Lateral agility is an asset on the defensive end where he can hedge and return to position comfortably … Versatility to kill center minutes at 6’11 … No defining quality but package to be immediate piece of the puzzle … High character kid that interviewed well during the combine process ... Has more potential than the average senior ... 

Weaknesses: His junior season was highlighted several times above and that’s indicative (for the wrong reasons) … The lack of consistent progress from Powell has been baffling … Given his size and skill level combo, the results don’t add up … A solid post player statistically but limited as he can only finish going over his left shoulder with his right hand, which makes him far too predictable ... Much of the ups and downs in performance can be attributed to lack of core strength and less than ideal on-court aggression … Junior to Senior declines in three-point percentage (46% to 26%), FT percentage (80% to 69%) and rebounding (8.4 to 6.9) are more difficult to explain … On-court temperament leaves something to be desired … Chasson Randle is a nice guard, but he should not be outshooting Powell 12.5 to 10.8 … Smooth operator but not an explosive athlete – this is particularly true in traffic … 7’0”5 wingspan was shorter than expected … Averaged less than a shot block per game for his collegiate career … While narrow shoulders might always restrict his build, he’ll need to hit the weight room for core and lower body ... Not much of a vocal leader ... "
"Strengths: Standing at 6’11”, he has an amazing balance and mobility for the center position ... He possesses a really solid and robust frame, almost 280 lb, combined with a solid 7’2” wingspan, so he’s well suited to banging in the post at the NBA level ... He possesses excellent footwork which makes him really effective in pick and roll situations ... soft hands and touch, he’s able to conclude with the hook shot in the painted area using both hands (even if he should improve the use of his left) after the spin move ... A solid free throw shooter, a good weapon since with his frame he’s able to draw contact quite effectively ... He plays with energy and intensity below the boards, he’s not scared of contact …Good rebounder. Defensively he has a great potential with his remarkable lateral speed and quick hands ... He has a remarkable feel for the game and basketball instincts, with several of the offensive possessions of his team usually passing through his hands. 

Weaknesses: He’s not a huge leaper or very explosive, his physical game is based on his strength so he could struggle against bigger and longer opponents on both ends of the floor ... Even if he has shown remarkable potential on the defensive end, one of his biggest flaws is his tendency to be foul prone, due to the lack of discipline (fundamentals, positioning) and attitude ... This combined with his temper and the consequent arguments with referees limit his utilization on the court to an average of 15 minutes per game ... There are some concerns regarding his maturity and his behavior on/off the court ... His game is basically instinctive, based on his natural talent, but he should work on his game comprehension, reducing turnovers and forced shots ..."
"Strengths: Quick guard with good size who has displayed point guard ability … Ran point the majority of the time during his lone season at Missouri ... Has a strong handle and displays solid vision … Has the ability to post up smaller players and still has quickness to create off of the dribble … Athleticism also allows him to take advantage of bigger defenders, can shoot over them off of the bounce or take them to the basket … Can score from all three levels and is able to create his own offense … Gets low on both ends of the court, moves quite fluidly … His lateral quickness and size gives him potential as a defender, could be versatile guarding the perimeter … Excels at pulling up off of the dribble, giving him the potential to develop a floater as well as spot up ability … Got to the foul line fairly often, shooting 83.1% from the stripe, which would lead many to believe he has a lot of potential from midrange … Has displayed some outside shooting ability. He can be streaky in a good way at times … Used to playing big minutes, and is in excellent condition … Really good body control, use it to create space for opportunities and finishes well around the basket… Decent rebounder given his position, aggressive around the ball … Provides versatility at the guard spot, size and length to defend multiple positions ..."
"Strengths: Smith is one of the most talented scoring guards in the nation due to a combination of excellent lateral agility, elite top-end speed and supreme aggressiveness ... He excels in transition because of his fantastic athletic gifts/body control and is always looking to push the ball and attack ... He’s quite possibly the toughest guard in the country showing the willingness to continually attack and finish despite being around 6’foot 160 lbs ... He uses a very solid handle (led by a strong hesitation dribble) to get into the paint and get to the line at an amazing rate, where he shoots a high % (80%) ... All of these things benefit him in the more wide-open game in the NBA ... Smith has come a long way in terms of decision making and shot selection during his college career, as well as showing times where he can get red hot from beyond the arc ... He uses his aforementioned lateral quickness and toughness to cover even the quickest of guards and never backs down from playing physically, even at his size ... He has tremendous instincts, excellent hands, impressive length for his size and always puts forth a strong effort ... Was not heavily recruited, a late bloomer, who has become one of the top college players due to hard work ... 

Weaknesses: The comparison has been beaten to death is that Smith plays like Allen Iverson and while it makes some sense, that typically ends up being a kiss of death ... Smith’s athleticism and fearlessness will give him a shot at making it, but he’s still viewed as a 6’ shooting guard in a league that doesn’t value that type of player highly, particularly one with limited shooting ability ... He’s one of the lighter NBA prospects to come along in a while and could greatly benefit from putting on 10-15 lbs, although that may cost him so of his ability to change directions and top-end speed ... His lack of size and strength has also affected his ability to finish at the rim consistently ... While his speed makes him a terror in Louisville's pressure defense, his size makes him a defensive liability as a combo guard ... He plays primarily off the ball in college and when he does have the ball in his hands you can tell the first thing that comes to his mind is “score” ... His 1-1 (2.9/2.7) assist to turnover ratio illustrates his questionable ability to play the PG position ... When asked to run the point, he shows a mediocre ability to do so ... Another concern is his inability to shoot from deep. (33% from 3) ... He’s very streaky/inconsistent for someone whose main forte is scoring … He must continue to improve as a shooter and become much more efficient if he wants a place in the NBA ..."
"Strengths: Extremely cerebral and unselfish point guard. Competitive desire to win and very team oriented ... A clever floor general. Makes great decisions, mature, always under control ... Has a great attitude, very coachable, has been described as a sponge ... Quick first step, very good at changing speeds, and uses it well to get by opponents and into the lane ... Good outside shooter, currently shooting 43% from deep on a high volume of threes ... Aggressive defender. Gets a lot of steals playing the passing lanes ... Great vision in transition. Often finds the open man halfway down the court ... Can drive and finish with either hand ... Good rebounding guard ... Has been remarkably careful with the ball for a freshman point guard. Has no more than two turnovers in any of Syracuse's games this season ... Turns it over once every 26 minutes ... Perfectionist. Shows a lot of attention to detail. At 19 years old, Ennis is still a very young prospect with many years of potential growth ahead of him. Being such a cerebral kid, there's reason to believe he will continue to improve well into his mid / late 20s ... 6'5"" wingspan helps make him the disruptive defender that he is and his wingspan helps make up for his mediocre height ... Versatile scorer. Can make shots off the dribble or the catch-and-shoot at a high rate ... Very mature overall player for being so young. He shouldn't have too much trouble transitioning to the NBA compared to other players his age ... Very adept running the pick-and-roll ... Also shows solid ability defending the pick and roll ... 

Weaknesses: Lacks elite level speed and athleticism. Though he will at times surprise with both ... Ennis gets a lot of steals, but he's not the best or most fundamentally sound perimeter defender ... Playing in Syracuse's system, he will have to learn one on one defensive techniques at the next level ... Has always had a cast of great teammates around him and could be less impressive when playing against defenders on par with his teammates ... He's a decent athlete and his IQ and instincts help him tremendously, but he's ultimately not the most athletic point guard ... Thin frame ..."
"Strengths: Patterson is a wide bodied 6’5 wing prospect who has the physical tools to translate to the next level … Long arms, has an outstanding 6’11 wingspan … Is an unorthodox blue collar type, who can deal with contact and embraces hard-nose play … High level strength for a wing prospect already … Should be able to see time at either wing position at his size … Solid skill level and is a Swiss army knife, able to do a multitude of things on the court … High IQ player, can generally be trusted to make good decisions and gives himself the correct chances to make plays throughout games … Understands how to create angles on both ends, which helped him to compensate for a lack of athleticism and explosiveness … Decent pick and roll player with adequate ball-handling skills … Likes to use basic misdirection moves to set up defenders, and had enough strength to keep defenders on his hip on his slashes … Developing shooter who made strides throughout his career as a perimeter threat, and even extended his range to NBA range when spotting up as a Sr. … Effective medium-range player … Very intriguing floor vision and passing skills as a wing (4.2 apg as a Sr.), proved in college that he can be effective having some offensive sets run through him … Plays the game at a very steady pace, rarely appears rushed or out of control … Fundamentally sound and sharp defensive player, as you would expect to see from a Jamie Dixon-coached player … Makes an effort to be at the right spots and contest shots, doesn’t lack in assertiveness and is a competitive defender … Contributes on the glass on both ends … Most effective in the half-court game … Seems to be a hard working player, whose development progressed nicely in college after playing mostly as a post in HS ...

Weaknesses: Patterson is a limited athlete who would be at a disadvantage on most nights at the NBA matching up with wings … Is not a very quick player, and would have to work harder to create separation than the average NBA wing … Not going to get nearly the amount of touches he did in college at the next level, will have to adjust to a much more minimal role … Plays below the rim, and will struggle to convert shots around the rim against more athletic frontlines … Though he is a good defender, how will he hold up against high level perimeter players on a nightly basis? ... Improved shooter, but is generally only effective with his feet set … His 3-point shooting is a make-or-break skill for him to stick in the NBA, and his percentages from downtown fluctuated every single season he was in college … Plays a very basic game, other than his passing skills he does not have many standout traits that will set him apart from other wings … Can be stifled by athletic defenders … Mediocre ability to create shots for himself … Not going to play the “prettiest” game, and doesn’t make razzle-dazzle plays … Doesn’t project to be a good transition player ...

Overall: Patterson has the size and defensive skills teams look for on the wing, and his high level passing ability is a plus … Patterson seems like he could be a player coaches love because he is a hard working player on the court who makes good decisions … He lacks athleticism and isn’t the best player off the bounce though, and that puts a damper on his prospects despite an extremely productive final season at Pitt … Still, his jumper is getting better and if he can finally get more efficient and consistent with it, he could find himself a role in the NBA … Patterson could certainly hear his name called in Round 2 of the 2014 Draft ...

"Strengths: Harris is a very well-rounded 6’4 205 combo guard with a strong overall skill level ... Unselfish, willing passer and does a good job of producing while playing a team-oriented game … Adequate athletic ability, and shows good fluidity and body control … Has a nice jump shot, and is confident with shooting as far out as 25 ft … Able to hit shots off the bounce, off screens and with his feet set at a good rate … Does a good job of making subtle moves off the dribble to get space for his shots, set defenders up looking for ways to score … Attacks closeouts well, and can get to the rim effectively when he uses ball fakes and misdirection moves to get a step on the initial defender … Can operate from mid-range, and seems to like doing so … Has good natural shot-making ability, can make jumpers when contested and delivered often when his team needs a key basket … Doesn’t play a flashy game at all, but is highly fundamental and pretty smart … Never has been a turnover prone player … Despite being a hair short of prototypical size for a SG, he has some ability to play occasional minutes as a lead guard … Good awareness, rarely is a step behind the action or asleep on plays … A very solid and well-coached defensive player, and will be able to defend both guard positions in the NBA … Shows the quick hands to get steals (nearly 2 spg as a Soph.), but also is a sound one-on-one defender who has active feet and textbook stance to effectively slow down penetration … Really looked a lot more consistent as a Soph., after a nagging injury slowed him down some as a Fr. … Pretty tough and competitive, proved he can play through injuries and isn’t one to back down from physical play, which was a must playing in the Big 10 … Has good skill level and is the type of worker that will make him a favorite of his coaches … Leads by example, and doesn’t have the kind of attitude that would be a detriment to a team … Will only be 20 when next season starts, has plenty of time to develop more as a player ...

Weaknesses: Despite having a reputation for being a cerebral, steady player, he took far too many ill advised shots in the ISO game as a sophomore ... Harris is not an overly physically gifted prospect, and is going to be smaller than most NBA SG’s he will have to matchup with regularly … Also not overly lengthy (6’6.75 wingspan) or explosive for a SG prospect to compensate completely … Probably not going to factor very much getting to the rim and finishing amongst the trees, pretty vanilla as a creator when looking to slash … Won’t get a lot of finishes above the rim, though he will surprise at times ... At times has to settle for tough jumpers because he doesn’t have the handle or speed to consistently break down a defense … Didn’t shoot as well as it may have seemed this past season (35% from 3), and shot more contested shots than he probably should’ve … Size/athleticism kind of limits what he can do on offense at the next level, will need to perfect some moves and use angles to create scoring opportunities … Can be hedged in pick and roll action by tall and athletic bigs, and can struggle with finding ways to clear the corner to score or make passes … Didn’t get much experience as a lead guard at Michigan State, which would’ve helped ease him into a role better in the NBA as a combo guard ...

Overall: Harris has some clear-cut strengths that will help a team, and there is reason to believe he will be a safe pick in the late-lottery or mid-1st round … He is a sound defender, shooter, and provides toughness and a willingness to do unsung work for his team … He’s also a younger prospect for a 2-year player, who will undoubtedly get better with time … His IQ is good, and is a competitive player with high level intangibles … His size makes him a slight tweener and he’s not overly athletic though, so there will be a few limitations to his game at the next level … Still, the good far outweighs the bad and he is one of the better prospects in the 2014 class ...

"Strengths: Bairstow is a brute with the ability to knock down the mid range jumper ... Hustles extremely hard and will bang down low ... Will give up his body for the good of the team ... Puts a lot of pressure on his man to be physical; gets to the free throw line (8.8 FTA in 2013-14 was good for 4th nationally in this category) ... Crashes the boards, has a great motor ... Really works for post position, and good at sealing his man ... Does the majority of his work offensively in the lane and on the block, but can also knock down elbow and baseline jumpers ... Was one of the nation's most improved players between the 2012-13 and 2013-14 seasons; even showed the ability to do some shot blocking his senior season, although this may not ultimately translate as a part of his pro game ... Has good measurables for the power forward position (has almost identical measurements and athleticism numbers to draft-class mate Julius Randle) ... High percentage shooter (74% FT Shooter, 56% FG senior season with Lobos) ..."
"Strengths: Just 18 years of age and one of the youngest players in the draft, Bruno is a prospect with rare physical gifts possessing a 7-foot-7 wingspan ... He oozes upside with his impressive wingspan, broad shoulders, big hands and long legs ... A good leaper, explosive jumping ability, very fluid, runs the court like a guard, which he uses to take advantage of slower and less athletic players ... On top of the physical gifts, Bruno has solid form on his shot ... He is extremely adept facing the basket and even shows the ability to knock down 3 point shots ... Also shows some back to the basket abilities, utilizing hook shots ... He is still very thin but has a good body and can easily add weight and get stronger without losing any quickness and athleticism ... He has a soft touch around the basket and finishes well with dunks and lay ins ... He is an interesting player on defense, as he has good timing for blocked shots, utilizing his great length and shows good defense against taller SFs and quicker PFs ... Good motor. A good rebounder, especially on the offense end ... 

Weaknesses: Undoubtably a project, Bruno will need a lot of time before he will be ready to play at the NBA level ... His entire (short) career has been played in Brazil, so it's uncertain how he will handle moving to the US and the rise in level of competition ... He is still completely unproven having only played in a minor league with limited minutes and in not so competitive games ... So it is difficult to translate his game to the NBA, he must work his intensity and aggressiveness on both ends of the court. He'll need to gain strength and learn how to play against stronger players ... He plays more like a power foward at this point than a small forward, as his ball handling skills are limited ... As a natural PF he must work his ball handling skills to put the ball on the floor to be a SF wich is his better position to play on future, on defense he can improve his rebound instincts and his lateral displacement to play against SF on NBA. Need some years of improvement to come but is a very hard work kid and a phisicall freak ...

Outlook: Coboclo is the ultimate swing for the fences type of pick, similar to taking a promising high school player who lacks any real experience or polish ... He has a very shy personality. He is a very simple kid with a great work ethic, very similar story to Leandro Barbosa. And similar to Barbosa, Coboclo has remained in Brazil instead of going to Spain or another country in Europe to develop against a higher level of competition ... 

Notes: Selected 20th overall in the 2014 draft by the Toronto Raptors ... Surprisingly left his name in the NBA draft after declaring his name early ... Stood out at the Basketball without Borders in Brazil in 2013 ... Reportedly did not work out for any NBA team ... Current teammate of former Toronto lottery pick (#8) Rafael Araujo ... It is reported that he will join the Raptors for the 2014-15 season ... 

Vinicius Panerari 6/27/14"
"Stengths: At 7'1"" Alec not only has legitimate NBA center height but also is one of the best shooters in the 2014 NBA Draft ... He consistently can hit shot after shot from well beyond the 3 point line ... With 29% of all his shots taken from 3 he was able to make them at a 42% clip and an overall field goal percentage at 47% ... He displays good agility, height, and a solid understanding of his offensive strengths ... He can run the floor and is a very dangerous trailer hitting the top of the key jump shot or the occasional dunk ... And his strength in the pros should be as a stretch 4 or 5 and used as a pick and pop player on the offensive end. On the defensive end he was also able to average over 3 blocks per game. Coming from a mid major Alec was able to give a positive impression to scouts at Adidas Nations while going against some of the best players in college basketball.

Weaknesses: Alec's lack of physical strength is an obvious weakness, as he shies away from contact and struggles to play in the post against bigger and stronger opponents ... Despite having great height at center his lack of strength would make him a liability on defense and he may not have the strength to guard an NBA center and instead rather be used in a zone or as a 4 ... Also because of his lack of strength he has difficulty creating shots for himself in the post ... He will need to improve his defensive prowess to become a rotational player at the next level ... His rebounding statistics of 5.7 per game is not at the level you would like for a 7 footer in a mid major conference ... Furthermore statistically speaking there are two outlier games against poor competition that benefited his overall statistical average where he had a triple double including 10 blocks versus Minnesota-Duluth and a 40 point game versus Fairfield ... Alec had an opportunity in his non conference schedule to play Wisconsin and go head to head versus Frank Kaminsky and played arguably his worst game of the season fouling out in 18 minutes, with 5 turnovers and scoring only 2 points ... Unfortunately for Alec, the trend of poor games with foul trouble against top opponents continued throughout the season as he failed to reach double figures versus Virginia, Wisconsin Milwaukee, and Belmont ...

"Strengths: A bigman who is quick for his size ... Possesses a high basketball IQ and can do damage offensively as a playmaker ... Not explosive vertically but moves well laterally with good control ... Willing to do the dirty work; hustles and seeks ""garbage bucket"" opportunities ... Solid finisher around the rim with crafty post moves ... A willing passer out of the post ... Combined with his soft hands, should have the ability to develop go-to back-to-basket moves long term ... At 6'10"" 255 lbs. has an adequate 7' wingspan, and a very surprising 8'11.5 standing reach, giving him legitimate center size ... Very physical and uses size and strength to his advantage... Can tire out opponents the way he constantly throws his weight around... Appears to be a team player. Practices with a positive attitude. This bodes well for him fitting in as a role player in the NBA... Plays with passion and aggressiveness... Still has room for improvement, but did up his free throw percentage from 44% to 68% (although in limited attempts) from freshman to sophomore seasons... Through eight games in his sophomore season, averaged 8.3 boards in just 24.8 minutes... Offensively plays within himself; does not turn the ball over at a high rate (1.2 TO in 20 mpg as a freshman and 1.6 TO in 25 mpg as a sophomore) and takes high percentage shots (60% and 55% during his freshman and sophomore seasons, respectively)...

Weaknesses: Simply has not played much basketball at a high level yet. A bit of an unknown in this regard. Has potential, but other than strong 2013 NCAA Tournament, is unproven ... Not explosive; think more Kevin Love than Blake Griffin, athletically ... Work ethic and conditioning have been questioned, but hustles hard when on the court ... Not known for low block scoring at this point, but has all of the tools to develop go-to moves ... The lefty's face up jumper is often rushed and without solid mechanics; has a lot of room for improvement before he is an effective pick and pop option ... Due to aggressive play may be somewhat foul prone ... Plays with a great deal of emotion and energy so there is some fear that he can only play at a high level in spurts and may struggle to sustain his level of play throughout an entire 82 game season ... Though just a sophomore, he's the age of a senior, limiting his upside ...

Notes: Tested positive for marijuana in March 2014 and was facing a season-long suspension. McGary wanted to return to school, but the NCAA failed to change its ruling even after an appeal. This ultimately led to McGary entering the 2014 NBA Draft rather than sit out his junior year ... After having minor role as freshman during 2012-13 regular season, had a break out 2013 NCAA Tournament and helped Wolverines reach the National Championship Game. Was viewed as having a high ceiling and was a potential lottery pick by the end of the tournament... Missed the last 27 games of 2013-14 season due to back issues which required surgery... Late bloomer and did not garner much attention nationally until his senior season of high school... Measured 6'11 (in shoes) 258 lbs, with a 7'0 wingspan at the 2011 LeBron James Skills Academy. 2012 Nike Hoop Summit Measurements: Hgt w/ shoes: 6’9.75, Ht w/o shoes: 6’9, Wt: 263, W-Span: 7-0, Reach*: 8’11.5 ...

"Strengths:  Athletic and energetic, Antetokounmpo is a strong defender, both on and off the ball … His speed and 7-foot wingspan allow him to cover a lot of ground, leading to a lot of impressive blocks from the help side … Sticky defender – tracks well and is unfazed by screens … Explosive, fast, and solidly built … Finishes with authority on the break… Unselfish and versatile – willingly does a little bit of everything … Shows potential as a three-point shooter in both spot-up and catch-and-shoot situations. Also, shows potential as a slasher to the basket …

Weaknesses:  Struggles offensively in all areas … Despite his athleticism, he has difficulty finishing at the rim if dunking is not an option – made less than 40 percent of his layup attempts, according to NBAdleague.com … Leaves his feet with no place to go with the ball, resulting in a number of wild shots and turnovers … Shaky handle – turnover prone and limited to mostly straight-line drives. Too right-hand dependent … No post-up or midrange games … Mediocre 3-point and free-throw shooter …

Outlook: Antetokounmpo should be able to help an NBA club immediately as a role player and defensive stopper. Players like that, such as Tony Allen and Thabo Sefolosha, usually have a low ceiling in terms of potential. Whether or not Antetokounmpo develops into something more will depend on if he can expand his offensive game. He has potential as both a shooter and a slasher, but as of now, he is mediocre from the outside, struggles to finish near the rim, and has no mid-range and post-up games… 

Notes:  A Greek national, Antetokounmpo’s younger brother, Giannis, had an impressive rookie season with the Milwaukee Bucks in 2013-14 … This past season, Thanasis spent his first year in America playing in the D-league with the Delaware 87ers. He posted solid all-around numbers, averaging 12 points, 4.3 rebounds, 2.1 assists, 1.3 blocks, 1.2 steals, and 29.3 minutes per game. On the downside, he shot less than 32 percent from beyond the arc, made fewer than 67 percent of his free-throw attempts, and averaged 2.3 turnovers and 2.9 personal fouls per game … Steadily improved his FG% as the season progressed … Played in all 50 of the 87ers’ games, with 42 starts, and was named to the All-Defensive D-league third team … Finished fifth overall in the sprint (3.18) and seventh overall in the max vertical (39.5) at the NBA Combine … 

Richard Harris 6/2/14"
"Strengths: His greatest attributes are his scoring ability and competitiveness ... He is a player who really wants to win and will sell out for the team ... Many scorers’ use the defensive end for 35 seconds of rest time, or don’t crash the boards hard ... Adams instead seeks an opportunity to score at all time ... While on defense he is great in anticipating passing lanes and jumping them to get out on a fast break ... He always sprints to the offensive half court to find easy points ... On offense he crashes the paint using his big body to finish around the rim ... He is also a master of cuts, exploiting his teammate Anderson's ability to create from the dribble. Adams often back cuts behind his defender for an easy layup ... Despite being a scorer, Adams doesn’t dislike passing the ball, finishing the season with more than two assists per game ... Perhaps the most effective part of his game is his mid-range game which is reminiscent of Rip Hamilton (though much different body type) ... Adams does a great job in reading his defender on screens for jump shots (Alford work with him on reading screens certainly helped him improve this part of his game) and is great in using his strong upper body to put his defender ""in jail"" to finish with floaters or around the rim, though he is not exactly an top athlete ... He also has really good post moves for a guard, often taking advantage of smaller guards to score or get fouled ..."
"Strengths: Standing 6’5” he has an elite size for the PG position, with a sturdy frame that will allow him to face the physicality of the NBA (he was able to withstand the physical presence of Marcus Smart last summer during U19 WC) ... Owns elite passing ability that few PGs in the NBA and Europe possess ... His height affords him great court vision in pick and roll situations, where he shows amazing passing ability and glimpses of pure creativity ... In pick and roll situations, he’s really effective in exploiting the screens to create the space for the shot or to attack the basket with his solid handle ... He has great body control and remarkable use of fakes with a big bag of tricks, including change of speed and directions ... He has a natural instinct and feel for the game, combined with a great maturity and basketball IQ ... Despite his young age, with his maturity and game comprehension he’s a great playmaker, his assist to turnover ratio is excellent and he does a great job in controlling the tempo both in half court and transition situations ... He has excellent defensive fundamentals and sense of position, showing a great attitude also in pressuring the ball ... Extremely strong mentally and shows great leadership ... 

Weaknesses: Average athlete, not extremely quick, he has poor lateral speed and he’s not explosive ... His torn ACL could still present a red flag ... His other big flaw is that he’s not a consistent shooter, especially behind the three point line (29% this season in ABA league) and after the pick and roll, he should work on his mechanics and release, which is usually rushed when shooting from the dribble ... He lacks a solid midrange game, especially his pull-up jumper, even if he has shown some improvements through the season ... His playmaking is really instinctive, he could struggle when forced to play something different than basic set games and simple pick and rolls ... On the defensive side he struggles against smaller and quicker opponents due to his poor lateral quickness ... 

Notes: Potential first rounder with sure NBA potential ... He’s another product of the huge Belgrade reservoir of talent. He grew up with the FMP Belgrade youth teams before being transferred to the ambitious club of Mega Vizura at 17 years old ... During the 2011-2012 season, he tore his ACL being sidelined until the following one, when he had a great season in the Serbian league and leading U19 Serbian national team to the silver medal at 2013 world championships (12.9 points and 4.8 assists during the competition) ... He participated at the U16 European championship in 2010 averaging 8.2 pts 3.0 rebs, and the following summer he won the silver with U18 Serbian team, being included in the top 5 of the competition ... He’s currently playing in the Serbian league with Mega Vizura, after a solid ABA league season when he averaged 12.1 pts, 3.2 rebs and 5.8 assists. 

Davide Bortoluzzi 5/7/14"
"Strengths: Solid athlete and left handed wing scorer that can score from all three levels … Really strong shooter from both the outside and midrange, stretches the floor … First step is strong and can take defenders off of the dribble … Capable passer who has some play making ability, unselfish … Solid conditioning, able to stay on the court for long periods of time … Has definitely put in a lot of work on his body and gained significant amount of weight during time in college without losing speed in the process … Range looks to be out to NBA 3-pt range, while shooting over 80% FT as well … His length is not tremendous, though has good size for a SF regardless … Has versatility to maybe play wing guard as well as showing some perimeter defensive ability … Will finish with either hand and is a threat near the basket … Lets the game come to him, rarely forces the issue and plays under control … Will take advantage of height advantage to post smaller wings … Gets shots in a variety of ways, through cuts, spot-up and even can be a threat off the step back … When he is focused, can be a disruptive wing defender due to his size

Weaknesses: Though he has worked on his body, he still has a slight frame and needs to add upper body strength, which would allow him to play tougher … Vast majority of offense comes as a shooter, definitely affected by lack of girth in his hesitation to drive … Not a great rebounder, which again points to strength … Length is not exceptional and also may contribute to issues on the boards and possibly defensively at the NBA level … At times he's not assertive enough, settling for jump shots rather than trying to use his size, speed and handle to his advantage … Averaged very few offensive rebounds, especially on a team that was missing size and could have used them … Defensive effort is questionable at times and must work on awareness at that end … Relatively low rate of getting to the FT stripe for how much he had the ball … Though he is a sophomore, his age is actually in accordance with being an older junior … Consistency as a go-to scorer still largely inconclusive, does he have the confidence and muscle to take on a sizable scoring load at the next level?

Notes: Measured 6'8.5 (in shoes) 204 lbs, with a 6'8.5 wingspan at the 2012 Kevin Durant Skills Academy ... transferred from Mississippi St. to Duke after his freshman year … Highly regarded high school player who has been strong as an “up-transfer” in going to a higher profile program … One of the top shooters in the NCAA this season, amongst leaders in TS% while shooting close to 48% FG and 43% 3PT … After being touted as having dominated Duke practices during his redshirt transfer year, has been a solid 2nd option for the Blue Devils … Projects to a versatile wing, possibly a very strong scoring option if he fills out a bit more … Seen as a probable lottery selection who should go no later than the mid-first round ...

"Strenghts: Standing at 6-7 he has good size for the position, with a big solid body that allows him to easily withstand contact at the highest European level ... He has a complete offensive repertoire: pull up jumpers, fakes, use of pivot feet and a great ability to utilize his body even in the post ... He’s really aggressive on the floor, with a great ability to attack the basket and get to the rim ... He has great scoring instincts, with the ability to put the ball on the floor and attack the close out ... He also shows great body control, and a good use of both hands, which allows him to create from the dribble with a good variety of finishes ... He excels in the transition game, often finishing with a dunk, plus he has an effective post game, using his strong body to post up smaller opponents, but his preferred option is always to attack opponents off the dribble ... He’s an improved shooter in catch and shoot situations, especially from three point ... He has solid game comprehension and good spacing ... He’s not scared at all to take responsibilities, showing great poise especially in clutch and difficult situations ... Despite not being a pass first guard, he has good passing skills with the ability to find teammates on the perimeter ... Gentile shows a solid defensive attitude, often being placed on the best scorer of the opposition, also showing his competitive personality ... With his size and frame, he could guard power forwards in certain situations, plus with his good positioning and quick hands, he’s a good ball hawk ..."
"Strengths: Napier is a gamer. He has a knack for making big plays and raising his game against great opponents…This season, he's become more of a distributor and has been less concerned with scoring. His assist total has raised from 4.6 per game to 5.9… Excellent on-ball defender with great hands (2.1 SPG) … Has become a much more efficient scorer this year. His field goal percentage has risen from 44% to 50% and, more dramatically, his three-point percentage has risen from 40% to 57% … An excellent rebounding guard, with 7 RPG thus far this season … Great at ""shifting gears"" with the ball in his hands. He can blow by the average college defender with ease … Stat sheet stuffer. Has become a legitimate triple-double threat this year with his increased rebound and assist totals ... Deadly step-back jumper … Fearless. Confident. Plays with a swagger, truly believes in himself ... Very good shooter coming off screens … Great finisher in transition … Solid free throw shooter (78% this season) …"

"Strenghts: Capela is as good as any athlete ever coming from Europe ... What really separates him is his explosiveness around the rim ... He isn’t scared of contact and can really finish above the rim with one of two hands ... He also can really run the floor on finding easy layups and dunks in transition ... Capela is still a very raw talent with a lot of upside, but has also developed solid instinct, particularly on the defensive end ... He also makes passes you would not expect from a player like him ... His ability to finish around the rim is pretty good, which makes him a very dangerous player on Pick and Roll situation and circling around the basket ... Defensively he is very quick, with good lateral movement and when locked in he can really be aggressive showing on pick and roll but also in switching situations ... In a good day he can be absolutely dominant in the paint at the European level, and with focus could become an above average NBA defender over time ..."
"Strengths: Christon is a rangy PG prospect with good end-to-end speed and athletic ability … Has excellent physical tools for a PG prospect, at 6’3 185 with a 6’6 wingspan … Physically, has the attributes to be a standout at the NBA level … Likes to play an aggressive style and is a true slasher … Shows some ability to finish above the rim … Has few problems getting to the rim in most cases, and shows a quick first step and adequate handles … Loves the transition game, and stands out the most as a finisher when he has a head of steam … Good at drawing fouls, and is athletic enough to convert at the rim … Looks like he could make a career out of his play on the defensive end, and should be able to defend some of either guard spot … Uses his length well on both ends of the court and is real good at pressuring the ball … Pretty active player with good toughness … Good drive and dish ability, and wasn’t a really turnover prone player this past season despite his relentless style of play … Seems to have room to fill out his frame, which could be excellent for him down the line … Still has room to grow as a player, and could really be a good piece for a team if he improves on some of his more easily correctable weaknesses … Improved his efficiency nicely from his Fr. To Soph. season … Seems like he should develop a good change of pace PG ... 

Weaknesses: Jump shooting is the one thing teams will need to see from Christon in workouts before they can decide where to select him in the draft … Right now his jumper is a work in progress, and although he shot a decent 3-point % as a Soph (38%), it was on less than 2 attempts a game … Doesn’t seem to have real confidence in his shot, and extending his range is probably going to take time, and some tweaking of his form … Teams will dare him to shoot in the screen game … A pretty raw player at the moment, needs more experience … Also is a developing floor general in need of true PG instincts … Doesn’t dictate pace that well, and struggles to get teammates involved as well as he should if it isn’t a drive and dish situation … Shows a fairly loose handle for a PG prospect when he can’t break defenses down with his pure speed … Is particularly shaky when he has to use his left hand, and looks uncomfortable when handling or slashing to his left side … Mediocre floor vision and tends to get selfish and force action at times…Free throw shooting needs improvement … Will need to add weight to his frame ...

Overall: Christon is a pretty good PG from a physical and athletic standpoint, and he’s an aggressive competitor with high level energy and good potential … He is going to develop into a good perimeter defensive player in a league that has very tough PG’s, so he has value there … Improving his jump shot is going to be huge for him, but his basketball IQ, and ability to run a team also are key … Christon’s draft range is likely anywhere from the end of the 1st round to the middle of the 2nd ...

Jorrye Nixon 5/20/14"
"Strengths: Hairston is a very effective scorer, both inside and out … Has a sweet jump shot with deep range – good elevation and a quick release … Though mostly a spot-up shooter, he’s dangerous off the dribble and off screens in catch-and-shoot situations … Uses step-back and fade-away moves very effectively … Makes overly aggressive on-the-ball defenders pay with a quick first step to the basket … With a sturdy build and a 37-inch vertical, he has no trouble getting to the rim and finishing through contact … Draws a lot of fouls, and is an excellent free-throw shooter … Terrific finisher in transition … Doesn’t have a flashy handle, but is relatively good at protecting the ball … Played some as a stretch 4 at North Carolina, and while he won’t do that in the NBA, the solidly built youngster has the potential to expand his game as a post-up guard … When motivated, has active hands and comes up with a fair amount of steals … Does not lack for confidence ...

Weaknesses:  Due to a combination of a lack of effort, a lack of awareness, and below-average speed and quickness, Hairston is a poor defender … In one-on-one situations, he is often abused by quicker players on both cuts and drives to the basket … As team defender, he is often in the wrong place at the wrong time – he doesn’t always rotate, and when he does, he has poor recovery speed. Also, at times, he inexplicably steps away from the action, as if he is playing with five fouls or playing for the Washington Generals … Appears undisciplined, lackadaisical – doesn’t make a lot of hustle plays, stands around a lot on offense, and often jogs down the floor on defense … An offensive black hole – once he gets the ball, it is never seen again … Averaged just .8 assists per game in the D-league this past season … His confidence can work against him as he appears to think that he's a stronger talent than he is, leading to questionable work ethic, and possible trouble accepting a secondary role on a team ... Body language while at UNC early in the season was, to be blunt, atrocious ... 

Notes: Hairston had one standout season at North Carolina (2012-13), leading the team in scoring with 14.6 points per game and finishing with 89 three-pointers, the second-most in a season by a Tar Heel. He made nearly 40 percent of his three-point attempts that season … This past season, he finished fourth in the D-league in scoring, averaging 21.8 points per game, playing for Texas. He made 36 percent of his three pointers and 87 percent of his free throws … Disappointed in the shooting drills at the NBA Combine, with some observers commenting on his casual approach … Hairston was dismissed from UNC due to a series of off-court incidents. Between May and July of 2013, he was twice cited for speeding, citied once for driving without a license, and charged with possession of marijuana. A gun was also found outside his rental car. To make matters worse, on two of the occasions, he was driving cars leased by a known felon, which prompted the NCAA to launch an investigation into improper benefits… 

Outlook: Assuming that he has learned from his mistakes, Hairston should at least enjoy an NBA career as a scorer/3-point specialist off the bench ... If he improves his overall effort and play on the defensive end, his prospects would be much brighter, though it is very doubtful that he would ever become an All-Star-level player due to his average athletic ability … A borderline first-round selection who will likely fall into the second due to his past indiscretions … "
"Strengths: Good all-around scorer … NBA bloodlines ... Solid outside shooter. Shot 37% from behind the arc last season … Good at picking his way through the defense and finding a look in the lane … At 6'6"" (6'9"" wingspan), has very good size for a shooting guard … Adequate defender with good natural length for keeping his man in from of him … Smooth athlete who seems to glide to the bucket with his long strides … He's a very willing passer and he recorded around 3 assists per game over the course of his career. Good at leading the break thanks to his very proficient floor vision … Pretty good ballhandler, especially at his size ... Averaged nearly 2 steals per game last season. Always looking to force the turnover … Plays with great energy and a constant sense of urgency … Good one-handed floater … Can post up smaller guards ... Shoots well coming off screens, indicating that he may be more useful as, primarily, a spot up shooter at the next level … Was The Guy at Iowa his last two seasons, so he knows how to step into that leadership role and take on the bulk of the scoring load … With solid athleticism, Marble is an overall good physical package with a decent shooting stroke to boot …

Weaknesses: Doesn't have a great first step or elite athleticism, which takes away some of the advantages he had at the college level … Has an awkward shooting stroke. He has sort of a ""chicken wing"" when he shoots and needs to tighten up his elbows … Not very strong. Needs to put on some muscle to finish in the lane … Not anything special as a defender, due in part to his strength, though he has good defensive potential … His 42% field goal rate as a senior was a bit low, although he was expected to score a lot for the Hawkeyes, so his shot selection couldn't be as discerning as he might have liked. Also lowered by a high number of 3 point shots … Big game ability? Scored only 6 points in Iowa's tournament loss this season and only 7 in their NIT loss to Baylor last season, despite Marble being the leading scorer for the Hawkeyes both years … Was a part of the Hawkeyes big-time collapse in the later stages of last season ...

Notes: Father, Roy, played in the NBA and was a first round (23rd) draft pick … Named to All-Big Ten First Team last season …

Overall: Marble isn't particularly quick or athletic, and his shooting stroke is good but not great, but he is a versatile scorer who had four years of good, veteran experience. He brings leadership and offensive versatility to the table and could sneak into the second round…

Jacob Stallard 5/28/14"
"Strenghts: Standing 6’6” he has a perfect size for the position … With his solid structure and athletic abilities he can definitely adapt his game to the NBA level, with the potential to defend both on guards and small forwards ... He possesses natural game comprehension and poise which allows him to play the role of offensive facilitator and game distributor (4 assists of average thus far) ... During this season he started playing as a secondary ball handler, but after the injury to Leo Westermann he has been forced to play as a point guard, showing remarkable passing skills and court vision, even if he's not perfectly suited for the role ... He has a slashing style of game, and with his solid structure he’s really effective in drawing contacts when attacking the basket or posting up other backcourt players, exploiting his size and physical strength ... This combined with his instincts allow him to also be a reliable rebounder and a consistent defensive presence ... On the defensive side he shows great attitude and quick hands, with the ability to put a concrete pressure on his opponent especially in 1vs.1 situations … He’s also effective in the passing lanes, with almost 2 steals per game this season ... He has constantly improved his game since his debut at the senior level, becoming an ideal glue guy for a contending team ..."
"Strengths: Labeyrie is a high energy role player who brings rebounding and defense ... He is strong on the defensive end and while shorter and addition to his hair has a similar defensive style and skill set as Anderson Varejao, but without the body and all around talent ... Has good lateral quickness to switch on the pick and rolls, good agility on the defensive end ... Good team defender and help side defense shot blocker ... Athletic rebounder ... His non stop motor helps him both on the defensive end and on the fast break... Strong offensive rebounder ... Team player who looks to make the extra pass ... Most of his points will come from put backs, dunks, or hustle points ... Added some strength to his frame over the past 2 years ... 

Weaknesses: Very limited on the offensive end ... Questionable feel for the game, although stands out on D ... Needs to work on his post moves and back to the basket play ... While over the past season there has been some improvement in his shooting touch, he still is not a threat in pick and pop. His ""hyper child"" intensity gets the best of him at times speeding himself up too much a la Mark Madsen ... 60% free throw shooting, could be better ... He needs to harness his passion and intensity and slow the game down... Does not possess the mentality to be anything other than a role player which can be an asset but limits his potential as a player...

Eric Guilleminault 6/27/14"
"Strengths: Deadly long range shooter who also brings some ball skills and above average athleticism to the equation … As his role grew larger, he added new facets to his game and increased his efficiency … Great mechanics as a shooter, gets up high on jumpers and shot at a very high level from both mid- and long-range during his time in college … Ability also increased as a playmaker, averaged 2.5 apg to 1.7 topg during his senior season … Standard size and length for a SG, averaged a steal and block per game during his junior and senior years … Lateral quickness gives him some potential as a perimeter defender, gives him extra intrigue as a two way player … Became much more confident and efficient when driving to the basket every season since he became a starter for Washington … One of the better percentage FT shooters in all of college basketball at 87.3% in his last year and 83.9% over his college tenure … Accustomed to moving without the ball and coming off of screens, his role will be to stretch the floor, has done it consistently … Played a high number of minutes during his time at UW, only had a single game his senior year under 30+ minutes … Was a team leader during his time in college, high intangible player who has improved steadily and brings a professional attitude as well as experience … Time at Washington has allowed him to play against a number of high level players in the Seattle area and during his tenure as a Huskie, knows what it takes when it comes to competing with next level talent"
"Strengths: McRae is a tall and long wing prospect who plays a fairly unorthodox game … Stands 6’5, and has an outstanding 7’0 wingspan, and he uses it well on both ends on the floor … Good athlete with solid leaping skills and fluidity … Likes to shoot the ball, and can make shots from deep or from mid-range effectively … Showed the ability to shoot with range in college … Shows some good shot-making skills, and can hit contested jumpers at times … Has an unconventional release (puts the ball around his forehead when he shoots), but he has a very quick release and is consistent with his mechanics … Good at using screens to get shots, and only needs a little daylight to get shots off given his release and size … Probably is a more consistent mid-range player than 3-point shooter, and shows good footwork and ability to make moves to create space for himself … Can put up points in bunches … Has shown more and more confidence in himself offensively over his career … Able to hit shots off the dribble pretty well…Can finish when attacking the rim on straight-line drives, and covers a good amount of ground with his long strides … Not a selfish player, usually can find the open man when he gets extra defensive attention…Has excellent defensive potential, and already shows the ability to be a tough and active defender … His length allows him to be a factor in the passing lanes and he can smother guards with on-ball pressure … Very good shot-blocking skills for a wing … Versatile on D, could be able to defend the 3 perimeter spots in the NBA, if not at least the wing positions … Should benefit from more floor spacing and a lighter scoring load, as Tennessee was often crowded inside the arc offensively and didn’t have any real perimeter scoring options besides him in his last 2 seasons … Developed nicely after starting his career as a pretty raw prospect, could have more untapped potential despite being a 4-year player … Knows when to be vocal and knew when to try and carry his team, showed some leadership skills as a Sr.

Weaknesses: Though McRae has good height and exceptional length, he is a twig at 179 lbs and will need to get much stronger .. Has a narrow frame and thin shoulders, so it will be harder for him to put on weight without losing athleticism more so than some of the other more thin prospects ... Some real question marks about his ability to add legitimate strength .. Struggles to deal with contact…Though he is a confident shooter, his efficiency can definitely stand to improve … Didn’t really shoot the 3-ball well down the stretch last season … His shooting mechanics also need to tighten up, as his inconsistencies can likely be related to his unconventional form … Sometimes forces contested shots … Ball-handling skills need work … Doesn’t hold up that well to tight ball pressure … Not a truly good isolation player, though he at times had to look to score in these situations due to a lack of perimeter scorers around him…A big high-waisted, and can be a little stiff moving laterally … Though he has matured and become a smarter player, his feel for the game and basketball IQ can still improve … Is 23 years old, so he is older than many other prospects ...

Overall: McRae’s ability to score, mixed with his really good physical tools could make him a draft day selection … He could be a good defender in the NBA and if he gets his jumper more consistent, he will have a real good chance at a nice career for himself … Problem is, he never developed the consistency he needed with his shot in college, and he’s a pretty thin guy who doesn’t handle the ball that well and is an older prospect … Moving on from Tennessee, McRae has some of the tools to be an intriguing prospect, and could hear his name called in the 2nd round of the draft ..."
"Strengths: Hustle player who was a versatile defender on both the block and on the wing … Built himself over his college career and added aspects to his game, hard worker … Does not have a very high usage percentage, though he is not especially turnover prone … Strong rebounder, battles on both sides and competed with bigger players … Tough in the post and was also efficient cutting to the basket … Logged major minutes in his last two years, well conditioned, constantly moving … Defended the pick-and-roll well … Very tough on-ball defender, with notable performance coming in the tournament when tasked with Andrew Wiggins … Good timing as a shot blocker, challenged shots well and played good help side defense … Rarely got in foul trouble, even as an aggressive defender

Weaknesses: Not a prolific shooter or ball handler, sort of in between positions as far as the offensive end is concerned … Did not get to the foul line often and only shot 62.7% FT as a senior … Showed very little from long distance, does not stretch the floor much … Gets very little offense with the ball in his hands, was not really efficient as an isolation player … Lateral speed at the NBA could end up being a bit of an issue at times … Measured in weighing less than he did in college, which may lean towards his wanting to play SF, where his ball skills will need a lot of improvement … Never a major playmaker for others in college … Not many moves on offense, will need to work on footwork and counters

Notes: Born in Webster, TX … 2010 Gatorade Player of the Year in Montana for C.M. Russell … Two time All-Defensive Pac-12 selection as junior and senior, honorable mention All-Defensive as a sophomore … Finished with 1,019 points at Stanford … Averaged 11.2 ppg, 8.2 rpg and 1.9 bpg in 35.2 mpg during his senior season … Very good offensive rebounder for a SF, not to mention the length and timing to block shots at a strong rate … In the thick of things in the 2nd round and could be drafted, seems to have earned a spot in Summer League or end up playing pro basketball somewhere ...

Michael Visenberg 6/25/14"
"Strengths: By far, Thames’ best quality is his ability to make jump shots from both midrange and long distance. As a senior at San Diego State, he made 37 percent of his three-point shots, and according to Hoop-Math.com, he made 40 percent of two-point jumpers… Uses screens effectively to get open… Able to stop, rise, and shoot very quickly… Not a fancy ball-handler, but keeps defenders off-balance with a combination of fakes, hesitations, and in-and-out moves… Makes a lot of shots with a hand in his face… Excellent free-throw shooter – made more than 81 percent of his attempts in each of his three seasons at SDSU… Gets to the line on a regular basis – averaged 8.3 free-throw attempts per 40 minutes as a senior… Takes care of the ball – committed less than 1.5 turnovers per game this past season… 

Weaknesses: A tweener – not skilled enough to be a true point guard and not big enough to be a shooting guard… Lacks the speed of a point guard, and is not vertically explosive… Dribbling and passing skills are below par for the 1 spot – played off the ball a lot at SDSU, with SF Winston Shepard doing much of the ball handling… Thames struggles to finish when driving – rarely gets all of the way to the basket and relies heavily on an erratic floater… Right-handed but prefers going to the left… Generally a passive on-the-ball defender – gives shooters a lot of space, typically goes under screens, and doesn’t make many big plays… 

Notes: Thames was named the 2013-14 Mountain West Player of the Year. He led the Aztecs in nearly every statistical category, including scoring (17.6), assists (3.2), steals (1.6), and minutes played (31.3)… Averaged 26 points in three NCAA tournament games this past season… Named a 2014 Associated Press Honorable Mention All-American… At the NBA Combine, Thames produced a wide range of results. He was arguably the event’s top performer in the shooting drills, making 82 percent of his midrange jumpers and 64 percent of his three-pointers. On the other hand, he had the slowest sprint time (3.48) among those who were classified as point guards; in fact, his time was the fourth worst overall. 

Outlook: As noted above, Thames is probably not suited to play point guard in the NBA, but he may have a shot at the 2 spot… He is offensively limited, relying mostly on pull-up and spot-up jumpers for his points. When he isn’t coming off a screen, he is often shooting with a hand in his face. He made a lot of those contested shots at SDSU, but can he do that on the next level vs. taller and more athletic defenders?

Richard Harris 6/5/14"
"Strengths: It's not every season that the NBA welcomes in a 6'9"" point guard. In fact, the comparisons to Magic Johnson have already begun for this kid…Has great floor vision thanks to his height and his instincts…Thanks to his size advantage over most of his match ups, he's able to post up on smaller guards or throw entry passes right over their heads…Despite his lack of speed and acceleration (Anderson's nickname is Slow-mo), Anderson is able to get past normal-sized point guards with his long strides…Great at leading the break. FInds a lot of good looks for himself and his teammates in transition...Good outside shooter who has made massive improvements to his jump shot since his freshman year. He's shooting 50% from three this season and 50% from the field…HIs long arms make him a terror in the passing lanes at the point of attack. He's averaging 1.7 SPG…With 8.6 RPG, Anderson is perhaps the best rebounding guard in the nation…Has a 7'2"" wingspan…Great at using spin moves and head fakes to make up for his lack of speed and create a shot for himself…Has the size and skill-set to play three or four positions…Has great floor vision in addition to the ability to see over the head of his defender…A very intelligent player who knows how to set up his teammates and make good, pro-caliber plays…"
"Strengths: Jefferson is a wiry strong PF prospect with high level run-jump athleticism…Looks the part, is 6’9 and has a great frame to possibly add as much as 10-15 lbs without losing his athleticism … Shows real good explosiveness as a leaper, able to elevate suddenly when stationary … Good length, an added bonus to his leaping ability … Can finish with authority around the basket, and will get his fair share of dunks … Looks good in the pick and roll game especially, and is capable of finishing inside … Pretty active and plays with good energy … Looks more and more comfortable facing up and making mid-range shots, able to hit shots most consistently from 15-17 ft … Effective with basic post moves that allows him to utilize his length and athleticism, namely his right hand jump hook and drop-step …Shows good hands … Physical, willing to get wide and set screens that allow guards plenty of room to slash and kick out to him for jumpers or finishes around the rim … A late bloomer, added new wrinkles to his game every season at Baylor and is still polishing some of his more promising skills … Pretty good at moving around the paint to find ways to get easy shots … Good rebounding skills, shows good activity level and always boxes out when shots go up … Effective shot-blocker ... 

Weaknesses: Needs to continue to add polish to his offensive game, not the most skilled player and can struggle when things aren’t kept simple for him … Doesn’t look to do much with his left hand, and can be a fairly easy matchup at times because he offers little variations of moves on the low post … Though he developed his jump shot nicely in college, he can’t be considered a consistent shooter yet … Expanded his range to the college 3 as a Sr., but isn’t going to be much (if at all) of a threat from that range in the NBA … Can be noted that he fell in love with his jumper too much last year, and got away from his strengths as a finisher a bit more often than necessary … Has some strength and added some weight throughout college, but still needs to improve his frame more (only 218 lbs) and desperately needs to get stronger in his lower body … Not a very good defensive player, and can be overpowered by bigger PF’s … Not a try-hard defender or the most aware defender, which is a shame considering his potential on that end and how active he is on offense … Mostly a straight-line player, doesn’t have the necessary ball-handling skills to take bigger guys off the dribble and shows a bit of stiffness laterally … Will be 24 at the early part of next NBA season, and his true upside is fairly limited after being a 5 year player at Baylor ...

Overall: Jefferson’s athleticism and physical profile are going to be his main calling cards to an NBA career … He has proven to be an emphatic finisher who improved his skill level pretty well throughout his time at Baylor, and he adds active rebounding as well … He still needs improvement in some areas, and his post game is a work in progress, also his age is a concern too … The 6’9 Jefferson does have some distinct value as a PF though, and is a prospect to watch even if he isn’t selected in the draft … He could hear his name in the 2nd round of the 2014 draft as a best case scenario ...

"Strengths: Bennett has expanded his game offensively and become almost unguardable during his first season of college ball ... Bennett's transition to the college game has been seamless ... What grabs your attention about Bennett is his focus and intensity ... Imposing physical specimen. Huge hands, wide shoulders and an enormous wingspan gives him great ability to dunk the ball with power ... He's very athletic, long, quick & fast. With a 7'1 wingspan & impressive inch vertical he poses nightmare problems in terms of mismatches ... Able to overpower smaller defenders & bigger defenders get ""outquicked"" and often dunked on ... Bennett is best at the power game in the paint, where at least 70 % of his scoring total comes from ... When charting his shots on the season he has literally scored from every power spot on the floor ... He favors the right side of the floor consisting of floaters, tip ins, reverse layups & dunks 60% of the time. Bennett's 42 dunks put him among the country's leaders. Bennett has made 23 3 pointers this season and averages 1 make per game. Bennett's sweet spot is the left perimeter where he's made 40% of his 3 pointers. His go to midrange move is his face up jumper from the right baseline ... Two words that bode well for Bennett's future are productivity and efficiency ... He is so efficient that if he played 40 minutes per game he would average 26.2 points per game ... He has the innate ability to create spacing which helps him to score whether it's freezing a defender with a jab step or flaring off of a screen to catch & shoot or flat out blowing by a defender for a power dunk ... Bennett continually shows his versatility which raises his intrigue ... Bennett's footwork is excellent, especially for someone of his size. Along with his footwork, Bennett's shooting mechanics are very good. His form never changes on his shot. His shoulders are always squared and facing the basket. His release point is the same & even his misses look good ... Bennett is extremely adept at drawing fouls and goes to the stripe an average of 6 times per game, knocking down 75% of his free throws ... Bennett is an adept ball handler and has gone coast to coast 4 times this season. He maintains a low dribble and is rarely caught upright. Based upon playing 40 minutes, he averages only 2 turnovers. As stated earlier, with his tremendous skill set & ability to draw fouls he commands a great deal of attention defensively ..."
"Strengths: A lethal spot-up shooter with terrific range … Text book shooting form. Displays a consistent stroke with excellent mechanics on his jumper, releasing the ball off his fingertips with great ease in one silky-smooth motion … Has outstanding footwork and generates proper elevation on his shot. Squares his shoulders and feet to the basket … Appears to have tremendous range on his 3-ball, and has shown the ability to drain it from the NBA-line with no hitch in his natural release … Due to his feathery touch and the great feel, he excels when it comes to converting on floaters and various acrobatic attempts in and around the paint … Understands how to move wihout the ball … Has shown flashes of creating opportunities off the bounce in a ½ court set or attacking his opponent head on off the dribble … Decent vision and passing ability for an off guard … Because of his length and athleticism, he can be a very effective on-ball defender along the wing … Impressive physical tools allow him to literally drape and swarm opposing players, which have contributed to steals and timely deflections … Has prototypical height (6'6) for a shooting guard at the next level and is a good athlete."
"Strengths: Explosive athlete who plays with great energy and aggression on both ends of the floor … Fearless slasher, with potential to be dangerous as a transition player … Plays passing lanes very well, and has a great nose for the ball … Improved his jump shot considerably, known for having a fantastic work ethic … Improvement over the past year has been remarkable and a testament to his work ethic. Shows a great will to improve, by all reports a fantastic kid and considered very coachable … Quite strong, very good at playing prevent defense and establishing position … Shot selection was highly efficient during his junior season, seemed to know his role and limitations … Has potential as a passer, though still keeps it quite simple … Follows shots really well, does not give up on plays and good at creating turnovers in the backcourt … Length and timing to block shots occasionally, good help defender … Worked on his handle and showed noticeable improvement during his final season at IU … Potentially can become a player with blow by quickness due to his great speed … Pesky defender who prides himself on guarding the other team's best perimeter scorer … Could guard multiple positions, even at the NBA level … Though he did not average over 30 mpg, conditioning and stamina appear to be top notch, should be able to log a good number of minutes"
"Strengths: His wingspan and height are perfect for his role … Possesses underrated athleticism since he doesn’t attack the basket very often ... Abrines is probably the purest shooter among European NBA prospects, with fluid mechanics, quick release, and a huge range ... His off the ball game is excellent, exploiting screens and cuts in order to reach the proper spot to shot … He’s extremely effective in catch and shoot situations, but he’s also able to create off the dribble with confidence and effectiveness, both using pull-up jumpers or attacking the rim ... On the defensive side his wingspan and instincts make him a good threat to jump the passing lanes, especially when his team plays zone defense ..."
"Strengths: Porter is a multi-skilled small forward possessing tremendous length (7’1 wingspan) and veteran basketball savvy at 19-years of age. He’s in constant motion away from the ball, roaming the baseline, cutting backdoor or settling into soft spots. Utilizes that same motor to get out in the open court and runs exceedingly well end to end; averages 1.45 PPP in transition. Plays to his strengths and works hard to ameliorate areas of weakness. He upped his scoring output from 9.7 as a freshman to 16.2 as a sophomore (48% FG). The key ingredient to his offensive explosion was improved long-range proficiency, from 23% to 42% (12 makes to 43). 51% adjusted FG% in spot up opportunities. Highly efficient in the mid-range from either elbow -- catch and shoot coming off screens (or working the middle of 2-3) and dribbling into jumpers with one or two habit bounces. His unorthodox style and arm length frequently result in contact; makes excellent use of the pump fake. He gets to the free throw stripe 5 times per game and converts at 77%. Prudent decision maker with ball in hand when asked to facilitate in the Princeton system- 2.7:1.5 assist: turnover ratio. In sync with teammates and uses the dribble to create better passing angles. His feel for the game and nose for the ball are highlighted on the boards. His length/motor/instincts (reading caroms) allow him to chase down misses outside of his area (7.5 REB). Contests every jump shot-- even when a shooter creates space, his wingspan negates a clear look (0.9 BLK). Hedges screens aggressively and disrupts hand-offs (1.8 STL). Porter was a late bloomer that did not play on the AAU circuit. Finished classes after declaring for the draft and gets the” big picture”. Stable performer, never see him flustered. "
"Strengths: Versatility and athleticism to play and defend either wing position ... Quick burst as a rebounder on both ends of the floor ... Very active at playing the passing lanes ... Improved shooting range substantially during his time at ASU ... Runs the floor really well, played heavy minutes and was constantly asked to defend the other teams best wing scorer ... Good at playing without the ball, scoring by slashing and movement ... Plays to his strengths, does not take many shots outside of his comfort zone ... Nose for the ball, was one of the better rebounding wings in college basketball ... Solid work ethic as he made great strides during his 3 years in the NCAA ... High release on his jump shot, solid shooting mechanics ... Gets really low in his stance on his defense, covers a lot of room, plus maintains similar low base in post situations to provide leverage ... Willing to get into physical situations and put his body on the line, definite hustle player"
"Strengths: Bigman with an excellent basketball IQ and all around athlete ... A gazelle. Runs the floor extremely well for a 7 footer. He's also has great body control for a center, showing unusual ability to convert plays on the break ... Plays with great energy, a focused and intense competitor ... Highly unselfish, team guy and a willing passer with good vision for a big ... Puts winning and his team over individual accolades ... Fundamentally sound. Great feel for the game. Never seems to be in a rush and very deliberate with his moves ... Shows solid ability to face up and knock down mid-range jumpshots ... Displays good hands, rarely fumbles the ball ... Good rebounder, good technique, anticipation, getting low and boxing out ... A solid defender. Uses his size well to blanket opponents. Stays between his man and the basket and doesn't gamble or bite on fakes easily ... Hard working kid, who should only improve over time and become a very solid NBA player ... Shows a willingness to battle in the post, and gets to the line at a good rate where he converts 75%, (averaging 5 of 7 per game) ... Ceiling may be lower than some, but his basement is higher than most ... Upperbody, while still in need of more strength has shown solid improvement in his 2 year Indiana career ... Made a solid decision returning to Indiana for sophomore year as he enters the NBA with a better NBA body and overall readiness ... In a draft with few sure things, Zeller will be a desirable prospect as a player with little bust potential ... Was very successful matching up with Anthony Davis as a freshman. Showed confidence, and played him to a standstill scoring over him using great ball fakes, and helped IU get the upset victory over the eventual National Champions ... Durable. Never missed a game in his 2 year career ... Post game is solid, using good foot work and providing a solid target for post entry passes. Shows a solid understanding of the basics and just needs to develop more diversity to his moves ... Has the size and versatility to play either the 4 or 5 positions ... Should be able to come in and contribute immediately, which is more than can be said for most of the draft prospects this year ... Doesn't have any major holes in his game ... 

Weaknesses:  Not a shot blocker or much of a presence on the defensive end. Can be overwhelmed by stronger and more explosive opponents ... While very composed, his moves can be too predictable, leading to blocked shots ... Unselfish to a fault. May never be a huge scorer in the league ... Seems to be more comfortable in a secondary role. Lacks an alpha male personality. As the team's most talented player, it was clear that Indiana could have used a superstar, vocal leader, but he deferred to teammate Victor Oladipo, who assumed the role of team's go to player and inspirational leader. Should look to be more vocal ... Lacks great post moves. Surprisingly, his post game did not show the development in his sophomore season that many expected. Still has a lot of work to do to become an effective offensive player on the block ... Should look to develop a go to move on the block ... Humble to a fault. What makes him a solid player, patience and unselfishness, may also keep him from greatness. He lacks a fiery personality, and appears more comfortable being one of the guys instead of THE guy ... Really struggled late in the year, particularly in the tournament. Syracuse's length and 2-3 zone collapsed on him, and really limited his effectiveness. His athleticism appeared so ordinary, some wondered if he had an injury going on ... Did not make the significant jump in productivity in his sophomore year, in fact, his field goal percentage fell of significantly from FR to SO season ... Sort of a jack of all trades, master of none type ... 

Notes: Registered one of the highest verticals in the combine testing with a 35.5 in the standing jump, and a 37.5 in the running jump, showing that he's an extremely underrated athlete ... Was integral in the rebirth of Indiana's program ... To his credit, Cody returned for his sophomore season to work on his game, despite being a lock to be a lottery pick had he entered the draft after his freshman year ... 

Aran Smith 5/6/13"
"Strengths: Canaan is a strong, aggressive scoring point guard who put up big numbers in college ... He's a deadly outside shooter who shot 42% on 3-pointers during his college career ... He's one of the best shooters off the dribble in this draft class, thanks to his quick release ... Canaan is also very proficient on the catch-and-shoot, which will help him in the NBA when he isn't handling the ball as often as he did in college ... A real tank of a point guard, especially at his height, Canaan loves to get in the lane and take contact ... Drew a high rate of fouls in college (6 FTA per game) and shot 82% from the line last season ... A pesky perimeter defender, Canaan is able to harass opposing point guards into losing their handle on the ball, leading to an easy break the other way ... Attacks the basket with assertiveness, combining with his bulk to make him very difficult to slow down ... Good wingspan (6'4.5"") will help him compensate for his lack of height ... Good leaping ability (40.5"" max vert) ... Very smooth, quick shooting form ... Good at using screens to drive or get an open shot, making him a solid pick-and-roll player overall ... Showed the ability to carry a heavy offensive load for his team, as he accounted for nearly a third of Murray State's offensive possessions ... Is effective on the one-handed floater in the lane ... Appears to be a very confident and poised player out there ..."
"Strengths: Athletic specimen at 7'1 with highly intriguing physical canvas ... He’s a legit 5-man with incredible coordination and agility for his size ... Gets up and down the court with ultimate comfort at 255 pounds ... Back to the basket game is on the incline- did a much better job establishing and holding position as a sophomore ... Quick and decisive moves, predominantly over his left shoulder ... Effortless leaping ability and 7'3.5 wingspan result in frequent high percentage looks (53% FG), many above the rim ... Active and willing mover without the ball, averaging 1.48 PPP on basket cuts (52 possessions) ... Consistent shooting mechanics with significant room for development; occasionally will flash confidence letting fly in the mid-range ... 69% free throw shooter ... Willing passing with burgeoning feel for the game (1 APG) ... He's added 30 pounds since arriving on campus from his professional club in the Ukraine ... Imposing upper body with wide set shoulders, supporting additional muscle should not be a concern ... One rebound every 3.3 minutes on the floor ... He possesses all the tools to be a prolific rebounder on both backboards (2.9 ORPG) ... Intimidating presence in the middle filling the role of rim protector (2.1 BLK) ... Capable of deterring shots both on ball and weakside ... Mobile defensively, unafraid to engage the pick and roll ball handler ... Moves well laterally and retreats on balance. Len will turn 20 on June 16th ..."
"Strengths: Talented & aggressive wing ... Good ISO game. Plays better with the ball in his hands ... Runs the floor well providing great spacing and making highlight plays ... A strong leaper, particularly off of two feet ... Huge wingspan. Appears to have in the neighborhood of a 6-10 wingspan, giving him good length to finish plays ... Brings energy to a team with his dynamic plays in traffic ... Will get to the rim and finish strong with contact, uses his long arms and leaping ability to get in the lane and crash the glass, an excellent rebounder at his size. Has shown the ability to get up and block shots off the vertical jump and from the weak side. His athleticism is well suited to the half court ... Can shoot the NBA 3 and beyond and has made big shots late in the shot clock ... Similar to his Dad, Glen Rice Sr., a very good spot up shooter and consistently knocks down the NBA corner 3 in catch and shoot situations ... Has made a real case for himself as an NBA player with a strong season, and even better post season playing in the D-League ..."

Has a high basketball IQ and knows how to get his teammates involved ... Makes up for his average speed with his ability to use his body to get open looks around the rim. Has excellent body control overall ... Can be a good scoring point guard (18.7 PPG last season) ... Very good ball handler ... A good floor general and a coach's son ... Draws a lot of contact and gets to the line at a high rate ... Underrated athlete who has a 40 inch vertical and deceptive explosiveness ... Solid, if not spectacular passing ability and floor vision ... Good at finding teammates cutting to the basket ... Quick hands (1.9 SPG) last season and good lateral quickness make him a solid defender ... Plays well without the ball, making sharp cuts to get good looks in the lane ... Rebounds well for a point guard (5.1 RPG last season) ... Despite playing in the Horizon League, performed well against good competition ... McCallum is a very durable player, as evidenced by 37 or more minutes in each of the last 14 games of the season ...

Weaknesses: Doesn't do any one thing particularly well, as there are several more talented shooters, playmakers, defenders, and athletes among this point guard class ... Needs to improve his shooting ability, as he shot only 32% from behind the 3pt line last season ... Shot low percentages on all jump shots ... Doesn't have great length or physical tools, which will limit him at the next level ... Has an awkward shooting motion and releases the ball somewhat slowly ... Is too prone to taking pull-up jumpers early in the shot clock, especially when he is not a particularly efficient spot-up shooter ... Needs to become a better free throw shooter. Shot just 72% from the line last year...

Notes: Played for his father, Ray McCallum, at Detroit, passing up on scholarship offers from schools such as UCLA ...Was named Horizon League Player of the Year last season ...

Jacob Stallard 6/24/13

Overall: McCallum is a solid point guard prospect who can do a little bit of everything, but must become a more consistent shooter to make an impact in the NBA. He could be limited by his lack of physical gifts, but he could also be a late-second round steal..."
"Strengths: Prototypical 2-guard with a mouth watering combination of athleticism and shooting ability ... A top shelf athlete with spectacular leaping ability and body control ... Appears to have just scratched the surface of his abilities in his one season of college ball ... Without question has elite level NBA 2 guard potential with the talent to eventually place himself among the top shooting guards in the league in his prime ... Shooting efficiency was off the charts for a freshman, hitting 50% FG, 42% 3p and 87% from the line (totaling 179, he was a point away from being in the 180 club) More efficient shooting than Steph Curry was in his freshman season at Davidson (172) ... Smooth operator. His jump shot is absolutely a thing of beauty and rarely do you find such a gorgeous stroke on such a gifted athlete ... Shoots with a fluid and concise motion and takes the same shot every time. Gets excellent elevation and has a quick release ... Has range out to college 3, and there's no reason to think he won't be able to extend to the NBA line ... If he plays with a top level PG, he will be deadly in catch and shoot situations ... His pull up off the dribble shows a lot of potential, as does his ability to blow by defenders due to a quick first step ... Ball handling potential is there. Has much better ball handling ability than he's been given credit for. Shows one and two dribble pull up skills, plus can utilize three and four dribble moves to get to the rim ... When asked to isolate, has done a good job of creating off the dribble, though was rarely asked to be a primary ball handler, or ISO, and spent most of his time running off screens for spot up looks ... Excellent off the ball, using constant motion to tire out opponents and has been coached well to wait for screens and run his man off them to free himself for looks ... Great at finding seems in the defense, running the baseline for ally oop dunks ... Has a chance to be an excellent defender due to his length and lateral speed. Despite their reputations, McLemore actually graded out much higher on overall defense in Synergy analytical statistics than Victor Olidipo ... McLemore allowed .625 PPP (points per possession) scoring in the 89 percentile (Oladipo .856 PPP and in the 39th percentile) Granted Oladipo has better ISO defensive analytics ... Unselfish, team player who shows solid ability to pass the ball for an off guard (even a/to ratio) ... Good size at 6'4.75 in shoes with a 6'7.75 wingspan ... Persevered through a rough upbringing showing a fortitude and inner strength ..."
"Strengths:  Athletic combo forward with an intriguing skill-set ... Runs the court extremely well and is a frequent target for lob passes in transition ... Solid size for either forward position, standing about 6'8"" with a long wingspan ... Displays the quickness/versatility to guard multiple positions at the next level ... Blocks a lot of shots (averaging 3.0 per game at the time this profile was written) and creates a lot of turnovers ... Really tough to score against at the college level, and has the potential to be an even better defender with added experience ... Is a relentless rebounder both offensively and defensively ... Already has a 20-20 game under his belt (February 11th at Florida Atlantic) ... Solid scorer as a freshman ... Has become a proficient spot-up shooter out to the college three-point line ... Is quick and decisive in the post ... Faces up well against slower defenders ... Active without the ball ... Creates opportunities for himself by making strong cuts to the basket ... Has solid instincts as a passer ... Plays the game with a lot of passion on both sides of the court ...

Weaknesses:  Could be a good small forward or power forward in the future, but has yet to really establish himself as one or the other ... Needs to prove that his shooting numbers this season (45.7% on less than two three-point attempts per game) aren't a fluke ... Looks like he's become more comfortable putting the ball on the floor, but isn't the type to take his defender off the dribble a lot during games ... Too right-handed dependent on drives … Turnover-prone ... Can let his intensity get the best of him at times, which can lead to a lot of mistakes and unnecessary fouls ... Isn't playing against high-caliber competition in the Sun Belt Conference ... Forced to sit out for what would have been his freshman season because of academic issues, though he's reportedly worked very hard to get everything together ...

Overall: Mitchell missed the first nine games of the season but has come back with a vengeance ... He's rebounding, blocking shots and scoring at a high level ... He still needs some all-around polish that comes with experience, but he has lottery-potential whenever he declares ..."
"Strengths: Natural scoring ability (18.5 PPG) and effortless range (37% 3PT) in a classic shooting guard frame. He displayed massive improvement from freshman to sophomore campaigns. A more relaxed shooter in his second year, fully utilizing his foundation for better balance to spring into the shot. Solid elevation and consistent point of release. The trey is his layup. One-man show at Georgia -- any possession where he found space to fire was a good possession. Pick and roll was usually the offensive set of choice. He delivered 1.03 PPP in 97 overall P&R possessions, and 1.275 PPP when running right side P&R. Highly efficient dribbling into a deep three or pulling up off a hard left drive. Posted a 58.8% Adjusted Field Goal Percentage in spot up opportunities and 50% off a screen. Quick release with catch and shoot in one harmonious motion. Got to the free throw stripe 5.3 times per game as a sophomore, up from 2.5 as a frosh (earned FT's in 19.2% of transition possessions). High riser off of one-foot behind a head of steam. Outstanding top end speed. One of the top rebounding guards in the nation (7.1 REB) - very much committed to finishing defensive trips and optimizing his 6'8 wingspan. Elite defensive capabilities: gets into his man, moves well side to side, has the length to disrupt shots and plays passing lanes tenaciously (2 SPG). Defense into offense is his forte. Shooting specialist with size and defensive/rebounding skills is never a bad classification."

Will battle tooth and nail on every possession. Mind over matter guy who brings intangibles that don't show up on the box score. Clutch performer who seems to shine when it matters most ... A tremendous leader. Relishes the opportunity to take the club on his back and carry them to victory ... Shows great consistency. Comes to play every game and had just a small handful of games where he didn't score at least 15 points ... While scoring is his forte, his ability to run the team and make plays for others, as well as maintaining above a 3-to-1 ast/to ratio is enough to label him a legitimate point guard ... Has really evolved as a floor general, dictating the tempo and showing the patience to allow plays to develop and find teammates ... A strong ball handler, though not elite level ... Shows the ability to find teammates on drive and kicks ... Tremedous in pick and roll situations ... His numbers show how effective he is averaging 18.9 ppg, 47% from the floor, 39% from 3, 80% from the line, and a 6.8 to 2.2 a/to ratio ... Validated his 3 point shooting ability by hitting a high volume (2 per game) ... Has a surprising 6'5 wingspan, giving him some additional length to get shots off and finish at the rim ...

"Strengths: Combination guard whose game is marked by a lethal capacity for scoring ... Averaged 21.9 points per game in 3 ½ season in Bethlehem ... His off the dribble variety is elite—hesitation, rocker and crossover—excellent shiftiness and ability to burst through an open seam ... He can score from anywhere, a truly unpredictable defensive assignment in the half court ... Highly efficient in both isolation offense and the pick & roll, resulting in a score % of 49.2% and 45.7% as a senior in each respective situation ... Renowned for his comfort level dribbling into a jumper from mid-range or distance; he’s also above 1 PPP shooting off screens and spotting up ... He converted 33 three-pointers (52%) in 12 games last season ...

Cool under pressure in the deciding moments of the biggest games ... Well-schooled and intelligent, operates like he’s seen it all before ... Singlehandedly carried Lehigh to heights unforeseen. Plays well within the team concept, yet still possesses the one on one package to break away from it when necessary. 6’6 wingspan-- major factor on both backboards (6.3 career, 7.8 sophomore) and creates absolute havoc in passing lanes (2.1 steals) ... From a mental acuity and physical maturity standpoint, he’s ready."
"Strengths: Great shooting ability for a player his size ... Has good length (6'10"" with 7'2"" wingspan) ... Effective pick-and-pop player ... His three-point percentage (40.5%) was among the best in the nation last season ... Very good on the catch-and-shoot. Extremely fluid motion ... Already a solid shot-blocker (2.2 blocks per 40 minutes) ... Had a good showing at the pre-draft combine, particularly in the perimeter shooting test, where he 72% of his shots, one of the best performances of all players in attendance ... Shows flashes of soft touch around the rim, which he displayed in higher volume in high school ... Has a fairly big frame and the potential to add strength ... Has the deceptive ability to get by power forwards defending him on the perimeter ... At age 19, Jerrett still has plenty of time to develop into the player he was expected to be after being a top 10 recruit coming out of high school ..."
"Strengths: High level passing ability … Tremendous length and height for his position combined with a high basketball IQ. Carter-Williams is a gifted athlete … He has the ability to handle the ball well for his size … Possesses the skill to burst through a first line of defenders, with a deceptive first step ... Can turn a broken play into points with an outstanding ability to find the open man ... Solid competitor ... Rebounds the ball very well for a player at his position…Defensively, his length allows him to create turnovers at a high rate… Ignites the fast break, finding streaking teammates for easy dunks, trailing shooters, or finishes at the rim on his own, MCW can be a handful for opposing defenders ... Was able to dominate running Boeheim’s offense at times, getting the ball to shooters in their spots, as well as lead the fast break, and create shots for himself ... A true ball hawk with excellent anticipation and reflexes put him into the top 10 in steals ... 

Weaknesses: Ceiling is considerable, but so is his basement, has star potential but also appears to be a guy that could end up playing the majority of his career overseas ... Already the age of a senior, so there is concern about his upside and how much his body and offense will improve ... Routinely passes up open shots ... His inconsistent outside shooting (29% from 3) will make it easy for opponents to sag off him, making it even more difficult for him to get by defenders ... Battled inconsistency during his first full year as a starting point guard … Turnover prone. His youth showed at times … He needs to improve as a leader, a floor general, to become the player he can be at the next level ... His upper body strength will have to improve ... Needs to improve his outside shooting... Defensively, he will need to transition from Boeheim’s 2-3 to an NBA Man-to-Man … Takes a lot of risks defensively, can get away with it in college, NBA players will expose this ... Was involved in a shop lifting incident at the beginning of the college season and while he was not arrested, the incident was documented and he'll be forced to answer questions from teams about it. Character questions have arisen due to the incident ... Credit Jim Boeheim and his system for making Syracuse players look good, but the track record of recent Cuse high picks (Wes Johnson, Jonny Flynn, Donte Greene, Dion Waiters(?)) has not been very good ... 

Overall: With his vision, speed, and ball handling ability, Carter-Williams possesses uncommon PG tools ... Proving that he can be a leader night-in and night-out is something NBA teams will need to see if they are to turn the keys of an offense over to him ...

Elliot Adamczyk 3/19/13"

Innate cleverness finding buckets in the lane; uses his body to create release angles and cut off angles for defenders to disrupt ... Deceptive strength hiding behind those long sleeves- arrived on campus at 165 lbs. currently up to 205 ... Initiates and sells contact, gets to the free throw line nearly 7 times per game and converts there ... 38% score efficiency in ISO situations, specifically driving right from the top of the key (62%) ... Exhibits high IQ moving away from the ball, thriving as a slasher/cutter/lob recipient ... He has a knack for making plays in late clock situations and simply “finding a way”. The 28th leading rebounder in the nation at 9.5 per game, tied for 2nd amongst guards. Rebound and push. Did a better job of keeping his head up on penetration and finding open teammates as a junior (3.3 APG). A high-energy defender with alluring physical traits and 2/3 position versatility. He utilizes his length to play passing lanes aggressively (1.6 SPG). Despite being a master of nothing, brings many positive attributes to the floor ... He will turn 22 in July ..."
"Strengths: Strong, big-bodied center with a lot of upside...Great length (7'5"" wingspan) makes him a terror on the defensive end and boards.

He runs the floor well and just seems to be comfortable in his own body...Uses his body to get good position in the lane...Very good rebounder thanks to his size and length...Expanding the range on his jumpshot. Can shoot decently from at least 12 feet...Good transition big man...Efficient inside. Shot 57% last year...Crashes the offensive glass with authority and gets a lot of put backs...Made a lot of progress in his one season at Pitt. Appears to be a very coachable player and a hard worker...

Weaknesses: Has not played basketball for a very long time and is still an extremely raw big man...Has almost no consistent post moves...Doesn't always use his strength like he should. Often takes the ball up softly to the rim and gets blocked or simply looks overmatched...Was not a huge offensive threat in college, so he still has a ways to go to see a lot of playing time in the NBA...Is an extremely poor free throw shooter (44%)...Often looks passive on the court, and though he plays with a lot of energy, he often lacks the assertiveness he needs on offense...Poor footwork...Not much of a passer out of the post...Is still developing a feel for the game...His hands are big, but they aren't very good, as he bobbles a lot of passes...Puts up a lot of very bad shots around the rim. Needs to develop a softer touch...Still developing a consistent jump shot...Has a low free throw rate for a man his size...

Notes: Chose to enter the draft after his freshman year to help provide for his family in New Zealand...
 
Overall: Adams is still several years away from reaching his ceiling, but that ceiling is a high one. He's very strong and very athletic and most of the flaws in his game can likely be improved with time.

Weaknesses: While a fluid athlete, he lacks the explosiveness and overall quickness and athleticism to stand out at the next level ... Lacks upper body strength. Appears to shy away from contact at times. A finesse player who is most comfortable facing the basket and knocking down mid-range shots ... And lack of physicality may limit his effectiveness on the boards and defensively ... Averagd 2.4 blocked shots per game, but there is some question about whether he could do that against a higher level of competition ...

NBA Comparison: Joakim Noah/Samuel Dalembert
"Strengths: Green exploded onto the scene in this his senior year becoming the leading scorer in all of college basketball while going from being a 2nd round prospect to a likely first round prospect ... At 6’4, 185 pounds, Green has below average size for an NBA shooting guard but does have good length ... What is so impressive about Green is that he improved his efficiency drastically in each year of his 4-year career ... Coming off the bench his freshman year, he shot 29% from the floor, 27.5% from 3 point range, and 68% from the line. His senior year, he improved to 48% from the field on over 17 shots a game, 39% from 3-point range, and 82% from the free throw line. Was a highly efficient player on a high volume of attempts ... ... An extremely quick and crafty player that pushes the ball in transition attacking the rim, which is when he is at his best ... A tremendous 1 on 1 player with a bevy of moves at his disposal ... Is comfortable spotting up or shooting off the dribble with solid shooting form. Shows good movement without the ball and uses screens efficiently. Has improved as a passer in his 4 year career, averaging almost 4 his senior year on a solid assist to turnover ratio. Is especially good at finding the open man off of the pick and roll ... VT Coach James Johnson is a huge fan of Green’s work ethic and notes his ability to makes smart decisions on the floor."
"Strengths: Point guard with effortless blow by speed to get by opponents virtually at will ... At 6'1-6'2, he has a huge wingspan at 6'7 1/4 ... Shows good form on his shot and his stats back that up, hitting 40% from 3 (on 3.3 attempts per game) and 84% from the line, averaging 11.9 ppg in 24 mpg during his season in the German Bundesliga ... Solid passer. Vision and playmaking skills seem to be developing nicely ... In the Hoop Summit he displayed a reliable handle and the ability to play under control at a high rate of speed, setting up teammates for buckets as well as an emerging pull up jumper. Granted that was against a talented but inexperienced group of high school prospects ... A solid defender, showing a good understanding of spacing and staying in defensive position with his hands active without reaching. Displays a lot of potential to be an on ball pest with his quick feet and huge wingspan ... Shows a developing tear drop and would be well served by perfecting it ... Also has a deft spin dribble move ... Schroeder's elite level speed is his biggest weapon and gives him a lot of intrigue as an NBA prospect ... 

Weaknesses: Still raw, efficiency numbers this season could have been better ... His 3.3 to 2.9 a/to ratio display his need to become a more efficient ball protector and distributor. Though it is important to keep in mind that he's still just 19 ... Despite his 40% 3 point shooting numbers, his shot appears to lack the ability to extend out to NBA 3 at this point, as he shoots a bit of a set shot ... Just 168 lbs. Frame is slight so getting stronger will be important. At this point he can be easily muscled and knocked off balance by bigger and stronger guards. Narrow shoulders mean he'll likely never be a physical player ... Added strength would allow him to finish after contact and better utilize his ability to get into the paint. It would also benefit him defensively if opponents attempt to post him ... Needs to develop the ability to go left. He is too right hand dominant making it easier to defend him by overplaying his right ... Much more effective shooting from spot up than off isolation. Gaining the ability to go left would help in this area ... Lacks experience playing against a high level of competition, having played this season with a low level German team (New Yorker Phantoms) with lower level Americans and Germans, and the team struggled (13-19) ... Will need to develop into a vocal leader as a lead guard ... Must become more adept running the pick and roll as a ball handler ... Solid athlete but not a dynamic, above the rim type of finisher ... 

Notes: Breakout star of the Portland Hoop Summit where he impressed numerous GMs and scouts ... Benefited from a tremendous week of practices followed by an excellent game in which he outperformed Kasey Hill and Demetrius Jackson. putting up 18 points, 6 assists and just 3 turnovers ... Game appears tailor made for the NBA as opposed to Europe due to his potential to break down opponents with his speed ... Named most improved player in the BBL ... There aren't a ton of big names on his German BBL team, former Duke Blue Devil and Arizona State Sun Devil, Eric Boateng, being one ...

Solid one on one ability with a quick first steps to get into the paint ... Utilizes a solid crossover as well as a step back move to free himself for jumpers along with drives into the paint ... Understands how to use screens to get free looks ... Catch and shoot ability is also good ... Shows the ability to utilize the floater, which will be important for him to polish ... High character guy with great background to make it in pro sports as the son of Hall of Fame shortstop Barry Larkin ... Mind over matter. Shows a lot of will power to succeed ... Positive attitude. Team/clubhouse guy. Will find ways to contribute ..."
"Strength: Standing at 6’11, Kelly has a nice shot at being a stretch four in the league ... A highly skilled big with great instincts ... Loves the game and has a tremendous work ethic ... A very accurate shooter (first evidenced on a national stage by winning the McDonald’s All-American Three Point Shootout in 2009) ... Shot 42.2% on threes this year on 3.6 attempts per game ... Is definitely more of a spot up shooter but has the ability to hit the pull-up jumper off one dribble as well as having a nice mid-range turnaround in the repertoire ...

Definitely seems to have a willingness to come over and play in the NBA, not much worry about a hold out ... Will compete defensively and has nice size for either wing position ...

Weaknesses: Still relatively underdeveloped for the physical rigors of the NBA ... Can be bothered by superior length and athleticism ... An average athlete, this could really hurt him defensively on the pro level. Lacks great lateral speed making him a liability in isolation ... Overall speed is less than ideal for a SG ... Very inconsistent shooting from the midrange during his professional play ... Spends too much time behind the arc and can fall in love with the long ball rather than mixing up his offensive repetoire ... Will have to go through a drastic role change and culture change upon entry to the league ... Needs quite a bit of time in the weight room before being considered as a rotation option at the NBA level

Notes: Measured at 6-7 (in shoes) with a 6-9.25 wingspan at the 2013 Nike Hoop Summit ... Was very impressive during the week of practices at the Hoop Summit in front of NBA scouts ... Averaged 16.3 ppg in the VTB United League and 16.1 in Eurocup during the 2012-13 season for BC Tryumph Lyubertsy ... Part of the Russian Men's Basketball Team that won the Bronze Medal at the 2012 Olympics ... Likely late first round pick who should slip no lower than the early second round ...

Coming from Russia makes it tough for him to adapt to the NBA and in particular American culture, or other parts of Europe … Needs to work on his mid-range game and become less predictable offesnively ... Too enamored with the 3 point shot. Instead of looking for other ways to score, he continues to jack 3 pointers even when he's not feeling it ... Needs to become a more consistent outside shooter (shot just 11-45 from 3 in 24% the U18 championships) ...

Weaknesses: While he did show some progress in Senior year, lacks much of an offensive repertoire ... Came into college as mostly a face the basket forward, his post game remains a work in progress ... Mechanical. predictable post game. Somewhat stiff, robotic, in his movements. Post moves seem predetermined and if the defense is able to react, he struggles to make counter moves ... For as athletic as he is, lacks great defensive ability ... Lacks great anticipation and ability to make adjustments ... Not a vocal leader .... Lacks a great deal upside ... Some of his senior development has to be attributed to opportunity ... 

Notes: Potential lottery pick who benefits from such a weak draft class ... Brother Miles Plumlee went 26th in the 2012 NBA draft, and isn't nearly as talented as Mason ... 

Aran Smith 5/13/13"
"Strengths: Brown is an oversized PG with a highly intriguing physical canvas ... More than looks the part. Standing at 6’5, he’s able to scan the defense unfettered, flashing tremendous court vision and a natural creativity (7.2 AST as junior, 6th in NCAA) ... Plays at a comfortable pace with the ball in his hands; chews up ground with long strides, but gives off the impression of “gliding” ... Takes advantage of his height on the glass- active contributor on the defensive backboard (3.7 DRPG) and instant fast break threat ... Dangerous in transition where he’s dynamic with the ball and forces defenses to commit, often resulting in the proper shoot/pass decision ... Boasts a 4:1 AST: TO ratio and 1.5 points + assists/possession in open court situations ... Deceiving quickness, lulls defenders into a particular speed before changing gears ... Hang time and acrobatics are readily apparent around the rim, preferring brush contact to sustain momentum ... Floaters, runners and leaners are more his cup of tea than traditional, set jumpers ... Shows potential with his back to the basket in a limited sampling ... Strong penchant for making plays on the defensive side of the ball (2 SPG). Brown displays huge upside as an on-ball defender, allowing .59 PPP last season when isolated ... He crowds ball handlers with his length and lateral quickness forcing them into panic halted dribbles ... Also possesses quick hands to reel in the fish ... Instinctual anticipation of habit moves/passes ... When operating in full flight, he’s a prospect worth salivating over ..."
"Strengths: Versatile combination forward possessing full complement of mismatch tools ... Takes smaller defenders into the post where he has good footwork and quickness ... Punishes less agile bigs with solid handle and craftiness off the bounce- isolation aptitude with variety of spin, cross-over and hesitation moves ... Decisive and aggressive (4.5 fta) finding his way into the paint consistently ... Efficient scorer (50% fg) both within and outside of team offensive structure (12.9 ppg) ... Thrives on contact and is deceptively powerful in compact frame ... Soft touch, uses glass and angles effectively ... Old school style ... Three-pointer has become respectable weapon in his arsenal (1.1 makes, 39%), a statement that could not have been made in 2009 ... Rebounds as a result of instinct and battling (7.7 reb) ... A natural facilitator- skilled passer (2.6 ast) with legitimate court vision and feel ... Has made steady improvements each season, adding new dimensions and fine-tuning strengths that might have been a tad raw ... Deceptive fiurst step and solid crossover are hidden skills in his arsenal ..."
"Strengths: A hard-nosed post player with good size and a load of experience ... Does an excellent job of playing through contact and finishing ... Has a soft touch around the rim, and his hook shot over the shoulder is particularly effective ... Great at drawing contact, and was one of the best of this year's prospects at getting to the line in college ... Definitely has an NBA-ready body, combining his 7'0"" size (7'2"" wingspan) with his thick, muscular 260 lb. frame ... One of the stronger centers in this draft (benched an respectable 12 reps at the NBA combine) who uses his strength to back down defenders and get good position down low ... Loves to get the put-back dunk and is a very talented offensive rebounder in general ... Added 30 pounds to his frame since coming out of high school ... An aggressive rebounder who led the Mountain West in the stat last season (9.8 RPG) ... Great hustle player ... Can score with both hands ... A smart player who is good at passing out of the post and finding the open man behind the three point line ... Efficient scorer (shot 59% last season) ... Deflects his share of passes ... Consistent scorer, as he generally scored in double figures last year ... Aggressive transition player, despite his lack of foot speed ... Best player on a Colorado State team that got an 8 seed on the tournament and gave the champion Louisville team a scare before losing in the round of 32 ... Showed vast improvement from his junior year at Minnesota to his senior year at Colorado State ...

Weaknesses: Very unathletic, which limits his defensive ability in particular ... Has very limited shooting range, as he took only nine jump shots his entire senior season ... Turns 24 shortly after the draft, indicating little potential for growth ... Much of his scoring and rebounding ability is predicated on overpowering smaller defenders, which he is much less likely to be matched up with in the pros ... His back-to-the basket, slower big post play has gone the way of the ""dinosaur"" in today's NBA ... His lack of quickness limits him in defending smaller players and the roll man on a pick and roll ... Largely ineffective shot blocker ... Too slow and deliberate and gets too many of his shots blocked ... Needs to cut his body fat, as it was one of the highest measured at the combine (9.6%) ... Poor free throw shooter (59%) ... Would be very ineffective in an up-tempo offense...

Notes: Named First Team All-Mountain West last season, as well as conference Newcomer of the Year...Transferred to Colorado State from Minnesota due, in part, to playing time issues with Trevor Mbakwe and Ralph Sampson III on the roster...

Overall: Iverson is a big, physical center whose work ethic and tenacity may land him a spot in the second round, despite his lack of athleticism and his age ...

Jacob Stallard 6/5/13"
"Strengths: Scorer with good size and athleticism for the 2-guard position ... Worked hard during offseason before junior year to improve upon and become a proficient 3 point shooter, knocking down 37% of his 3s on over 5 attempts per game ... Plays with good energy and intensity. A self starter, not a player that needs to be pushed to get the most out of his abilities ... An above average run jump athlete, excellent in transition. Finishes well on the break ... Professional approach ... Hard worker, competes hard ... Accepts his role within a team concept and plays unselfish ... Solid decision maker and passer at the 2 position, maintaining a positive a/to ratio throughout his college career ... Scoring numbers did not increase substantially, but his efficiency did ... Pro jumper. Shows great form on his shot. Gets a lot of lift and shoots the ball from a high release point ... Stays active and moves well off the ball. Does a good job of freeing himself and shooting off of screens ... Shows pick and roll ability as ball handler ... Benefits from being the son of a former pro, having grown up around the game shows excellent maturity and perspective of what it takes to be a pro which should help with the transition to the next level ..."
"Strengths: Incredible pound-for-pound rebounder, averaged over 10 rpg in his 4 year college career and was one of the NCAA's premier per-minute rebounders ... Toughness which allows him to do damage in the paint, fantastic nose for the ball ... Hustles and fights for offensive rebounds, gets most of his points near the basket ... Has some ability to put the ball on the floor in space ... Good passer with solid vision ... Gets to the foul line with aggressive play, has a high rate for doing so with the limited possessions he uses ... Plays passing lanes well, pesky defender with nice hands ... Willing to sacrifice his body by taking charges, not afraid of getting in harms way ... Off ball defense is solid due to his hustle, will front people to stop them from getting to their spots ... Very low maintainance with a strong work ethic ... Used to playing without the ball, very willing to set screens and do the dirty work ... Gives maximum effort in his minutes on the floor, contributions come beyond the stat sheet"
"Strengths: At 6’7, 207 pounds, Bullock has good size and length for the NBA SG position ... Showed vast improvement in each season at UNC shooting the ball and was one of the ACC’s top 3 shooters this year ... Took on much more of a leadership role at UNC his junior year and was easily Carolina’s most consistent performer ... Shot almost 44% from deep on 5.8 attempts per game (over half of his overall field goal attempts a game) ... Has a text book shooting stroke and a quick release ... Moves well without the ball and shoots it very well running off of screens or spotting up for open looks ... Bullock is a very smart player that plays to his strengths and ""stays within himself"" ... Prudent ball protector. Only averaged 1.2 turnovers a game while playing the most minutes for the Heels at 31.4 per game ... A great rebounder for his size (6.5 per game), especially evident when UNC switched to their smaller line up late in the season ... Has a nice Euro step move when going into the lane ... Could turn out to be the perfect scoring role player for a team in the NBA ... 

Weaknesses: Plays a finesse game and could stand to get a lot tougher ... Bullock does not possess great 1-on-1 skills due to his lack of ball handling ability and ability to drive by opponents ... Will need facilitators on the floor to set him up as his ability to create shots is virtually nonexistant ... Despite being highly recruited and seen as an elite athlete in high school, did not show it while at UNC ... Rarely even tried to dunk the basketball and sometimes would miss close range shots because he did not go up strong with the ball .. Did not take the offensive strides many expected in his new role his junior year. Decent at finishing around the rim but definitely needs to develop a better floater/tear drop game to succeed at the next level ... Not an aggressive enough player going to the rim, evidenced by him only averaging 2.1 free throw attempts per game ... Needs to improve his ball handling if he ever wants to be an NBA shooting guard and strength if he wants to be a starting forward ... Considering his size and athleticism, Bullock should be a much better defender. He doesn't seem to put the same emphasis on it and his focus and intensity are not great ... Doesn;t seem to like to get his hands dirty and get physical on the defensive end and his numbers show that he's a below average on ball and overall defender ... Leaves you wanting more, and wondering if he had more competitiveness and toughness how much better he could be ... 

Notes: The combine and workouts will be important for Bullock’s draft stock as he may get to show scouts athleticism not seen during his college career.

"
"Strengths: Lauvergne has impressive physical tools from an athletic standpoint for European standards, standing 6’11” he has remarkable mobility and speed, with the ability to finish above the rim quite easily ... His speed allows him to be quite effective when served in secondary transition game, often concluding with the dunk … In the half court game, he’s always active and mobile, showing good instincts for the offensive rebound ... He’s showing good room for improvement from a technical standpoint, with his game based mostly on his motor and mobility ... On the defensive end he’s able to contest shot on the perimeter thanks to his mobility, granting flexibility to all the team defensive system with his ability to guard smaller opponents in one on one situations."
"Strengths: One of the NCAA’s premier all-around rebounders, willing to sacrifice his body for boards … Gets off the ground really quickly, great recovery for second jump … Plays much bigger than his height, has the tenacity to be a viable defender for either forward position … Good nose for the ball, has an ability to play prevent defense and patrol the passing lanes … Has timing to block shots occasionally … Showed great improvement as a passer during his time in college … Willing to put his body on the line, setting screens and taking charges … Can get baskets in the paint on hustle plays, shot a very high % from inside the arc … In very good condition, played a high volume of minutes in college … Led a very successful entry into the Pac-12 conference, energy is high and contagious, large attribution to the most success Colorado has had in years ..."
"Strengths: Experienced college player who was a four year contributor, three year starter and leader on a consistently succesful team ... Improved his decision making over his time as starting PG at Louisville ... Very effective at running the pick and roll ... Compact with a quick first step and some strong bounce ... Plays with a lot of emotion, and when he's going well can really lift the team from an emotional stand point ... Played on teams that stressed defense, keeps stance very low to the ground and can get in passing lanes ... Became a pass first PG after being known more as a scorer, willing to take on a role to help his team ... Has leadership qualities, solid intangibles ... A natural leader ... Heart and soul of the Louisville championship team, has been through quite a bit and seems to carry a very positive, contagious attitude ... Explosive leaper, as he showed converting an ally oop in the National Championship game."
"Strengths: Gobert has an amazing (7-foot-9) wingspan combined with a skinny but athletic frame … Coordination and ability to run the floor are above average for a big man … His agility and reflexes make him a solid athlete, even by NBA standards … He has a reliable hook shot with his right hand plus he has good instinct for the put back ... Shot shows solid touch, giving him nice potential to develop further offensively ... He’s really fast running the floor, and when he has momentum he’s difficult to stop, thanks to his speed and coordination ... His mobility makes him difficult to guard for opposing bigmen, especially in pick and roll situations, often generating mismatches ... His wingspan allows his team to put defensive pressure on opponents …Rim protector. His length disrupts passing lanes and he makes the basket difficult to reach for opposing guard's penetrations ... He has good timing for blocks, thanks to his agility and coordination ... His length makes him a formidable presence in the post and he should be able to develop into a shot blocker / changer / intimidator ... Shows a good body to add weight, and his toughness is also not a big area of concern and should improve along with his strength, over time ..."
"Strengths: Strong, athletic big man...Oriakhi is a very active player who crashes the boards, defends the paint, and cuts to the basket with tenacity...Worked hard to put on muscle and reduce body fat after arriving at Missouri, which made him a very good athlete...Very efficient in the post (64% on FGs last season)...Gets numerous second chance points...Talented rebounder and shot blocker for his size thanks to a massive 7'3"" wingspan...Has the ability to pump-fake defenders into leaving their feet...Assertive when operating on the low block, as he aggressively backs down his defender...Can play center or power forward...Good hands...An effective pick-and-roll player (shot 79% as roll man last season)...Has a good, strong body for an NBA power forward...75% free throw shooter..."
"Strengths: Livio is a very long (7'2 wingspan) and fluid athlete who plays with high intensity and energy ... Excels in the role of garbage man, slashing to the basket and scoring on put backs ... Very agile player showing excellent speed in the open floor ... A strong defender doing an excellent job of crowding opponents using his great length, reflexes and quick feet ... A scorer more than a shooter, but shows the ability to knock down mid-range jumpers with solid form ... Crafty around the basket and shows the ability to face up and get by his man and to the rim ... Good attitude. Hard working kid who shows the desire to improve ... Fits the role well of an energy role player, providing a spark with effort, defense and some scoring, without needing plays called for him ..."
"Strengths: Combo forward with an absolute knack for scoring ... Experience. Had an excellent 3 year college career for the Buckeyes ... Has a diverse arsenal of offensive skills that make him a natural scorer ... Uses his big frame to back down smaller defenders ... Good face-up game ... Solid 3pt. shooter (34% in '12-'13) who can space the floor as a ""stretch"" forward ... Finds unconventional ways to score around the rim ... Comfortable on offense playing either forward position ... Gets numerous open looks off of screens ... Good at finding (and making) open threes in transition ... Effective on the catch-and-shoot ... Adept at getting off shots without a great deal of space ... Works well with his teammates and should adapt to his NBA team's offense with ease ... One-handed floater is consistent ... Solid offensive rebounder, skilled at getting tip-ins off of missed shots ... Great combination of aggressive play and efficiency ... Good free-throw shooter, especially for his size (83%) ... Incredible consistency on offense, as he scored at least 14 points in all but one game last season ... Thomas' left-handedness adds a unique aspect to his game ... 

Weaknesses: Tweener. What was versatility in college translates to lack of a true position in the NBA ... Defense is extremely suspect. Lacks flexibility. Stiff body and ankles. Lacks lateral speed ... Finding a place for him on defense will be difficult as his lack of quickness and foot speed will make it tough for him to stay in front of NBA SF's, and his lack of size will make it difficult to guard NBA PF's ... Lack of foot speed will also affect his offensive effectiveness off the dribble ... His rebounding rate was somewhat lacking in college, especially compared to other college PF's ... Much of his offense inside the 3pt. line is predicated on overpowering the weaker defenders he was matched up with in college, which will limit his productivity in the NBA ... Doesn't have the quickness to get past most NBA defenders ... Underwhelming athleticism ... Though his big frame can be advantageous, it can also limit him in some ways...

Overall: Thomas is a versatile offensive talent who can score in a variety of ways, but his unconventional body type and lack of outstanding athleticism could potentially limit him on offense and be a liability on defense..."
"Strengths: Bojan is typical European PF who shoots the ball really well as well as play on the low post with his back to the basket ... He is a stretch PF who can effectively hit outside shots ... He loves playing P&R and he is smart enough to recognize who is guarding him at all times ... He will roll and post up smaller defenders and bigger opponents will take outside the paint ... Due to his big body he can also play the C position, which Valencia used him some this year ... Bojan shot the ball well this year in ACB League [47.4% for 3pts in Spanish League and 38.9% in EuroCup], shows great shot selection and does not force shots ... Catch and shoot is extremely fluid. Doesn't need to bring the ball down, can catch and release with great accuracy ... On the low post, he likes turning to his left shoulder and he shows a good touch and great timing and can score out of hook shots ... He does not have a lot of post moves but his basketball IQ compensates for the lack of repertoire under the basket ... Good length. Has a 7'1 wingspan ... More athletic than he appears with a 29 inch no step vertical ..."
"Strenghts: Nedovic has standout athletic abilities, probably the best in Europe for his position, combined with a solid physical structure from the muscular standpoint … In the open court he’s really effective, with the ability to finish above the rim basically on every transition … He has the ability to beat defenders thanks to his quick first step and his crossover moves, especially after the screen in pick and roll situations ... He shows nice ball handling, good P&R execution and effective decision making especially in the open court … He has a slashing style of game, able to draw fouls and withstand contact when off balance … He plays with maturity and confidence, showing reliable leadership skills … He shows some glimpses in P&R situations, especially in the first seconds of the offense."
"Strengths: Small forward with a powerful body ... Great shooter, one of the quickest releases in Europe .... He can create his own shot from off the dribble as well as shoot coming off screens. The big thing that stands out about Janis is his strong, athletic body, with great bounce ... Gets some highlight finishes and will dunk on players if they are unsuspecting ... His ability to defend and knock down 3s makes him an intriguing prospect for today's NBA ..."
"Strengths: Has some of the best physical tools of an any wing prospect in the 2012 class … Stands at 6’7 and weighs just under 230 lbs, and is put together very nicely, with his muscle being evenly placed throughout his upper and lower body … On top of being physically mature, Taylor is also a high-level athlete who is very fast for his size and a powerful leaper who likes to take off on 2 feet … Strong finisher who has highlight-reel caliber athleticism, but is much more likely to finish with a safe, and often powerful, 2-hand jam than he is to try a fancy dunk … Runs the floor extremely well, and can beat the entire defense down the floor for easy buckets at times … Taylor is best on offense when he can move without the ball to find open spots to get high percentage looks around the basket … Will make a big man pay if they aren’t aware of him on the weakside … You have to watch out for him on baseline slashes … Is effective on straight line slashes to the rim, where his quick step, strength, long strides and athleticism allow him to be effective on his way to the hoop … Improved his jump shot nicely in his 4 years at Vandy … Came to college with no 3 point range, and took steps forward in each of his seasons, being a 42% shooter from deep as a Sr. on more than 4 attempts a night … Also got better from mid-range as his career progressed … Has high-level potential on the defensive end, and his defense could be where his most value as a prospect lies … Is versatile on this end, and defended everything except C when at Vandy…Is very fundamentally sound and moves his feet very well … Has the size to defend SG’s and a lot of the bigger SF’s in time … Was arguably the best defending wing in the SEC last season, even though Kentucky’s Michael Kidd-Gilchrist got most of the pub … Always contests shots … Is great at knowing when to gamble for passing lane steals and when to just play solid defense against his man … Solid passer, who is unselfish and plays within the scheme … Doesn’t play outside of his role, and seems to be an unselfish teammate … Has some ability to post up due to playing extended time at the PF spot for Vandy, and isn’t bad in these instances with a basic jump hook … Rebounds pretty well on the wing on both ends, but particularly offensively … Improved very steadily over his career, developing everything from his jump shot to even his body … Could be better in an up-tempo style than at a slower pace like Vandy played … Extremely productive player for Vandy, who was on the All-SEC 1st Team as a Sr., and 2nd Team as a Soph. and Jr … Started every game except 1 during his Vandy career, a testament to his durability and value to the program ...

Weaknesses: The biggest chink in Taylor’s arsenal is clearly his ball-handling ability … Struggles with change of direction dribbles, and was used in these instances a bit too much for Vandy which magnified it a bit more than it probably should’ve been … Shouldn’t be asked to take more than 2 or 3 dribbles offensively to be at his best … Very reliant on his strong (right) hand … Although Taylor is a great athlete, he is a bit mechanical with the ball in his hands … Even with his jump being a weapon for him his last 2 seasons, teams will want to see how he adjusts to the deeper NBA range and prove that he is respectable with his shot … Mediocre mid-range game … Has a history of disappearing from games at bad times and having shaky confidence and aggression … Physically gifted, but has a 6’6 wingspan and seemingly small hands at 6’7, which is subpar for his size and may make him play a hair smaller than he actually is … Doesn’t project to be more than a 4th option scorer at best whenever he’s on the floor ...

Overall: Overall, Taylor is still a work in progress offensively and probably will never develop into a high level scorer … But he is physically gifted, a great athlete, and he understands his limitations as a player and is real efficient … His ability to play in transition and score without having the ball a lot will help him as a role player, especially with the right PG and scheme, and he is as good a perimeter defender in the class potentially … He had a decorated career and a bunch of experience, so he could get on the floor some as a rookie … Legit chance to be a 1st round pick, but could drop to the 2nd and be a nice value pick for a team who needs size, athleticism and defense on the perimeter ...

Jorrye Nixon 5/30/12"
"Strengths: Certainly one of the most complete guards of the young generation in Europe ... Born in 1991and appears ready for the 2012 NBA Draft after two years in Liga ACB (Spanish League) ... Tomas is a point guard with great size, excellent vision and ability to pass the ball ... Physically strong, allowing him to easily finish near the rim ... He is a good spot-up shooter, with range out to the three point line ... Shooting is not his first offensive option, but in the last Eurocup season he averaged 43% from the distance ... He's a smooth player with a quick first step and a strong ability to finish in traffic ... He also possesses standout athletic ability by European standards (he's a spectacular dunker!) ... He has a winning spirit, and always competes hard ... He is also a good defensive player because of his desire, athleticism and the versatility to defend multiple positions ...

Weaknesses: One-on-one game needs improvement for the NBA ... Lacks an in-between game, his shot off the dribble is not very solid ... In general he’s not very good to create own shot ... Despite his strong body is not a good rebounder ... Plays the PG position but may need to transition over the the 2 position for the NBA ... Needs to become a little more assertive, (vocal leadership) particularly if he wants to play PG ... 

Notes: in 2010 he won the Liga ACB Slam Dunk Contest with an incredible show ... Has the talent to get consideration for the end of first round ... At the 2011 adidas Eurocamp, Satoransky measured: height: 6'5"", height w/shoes: 6'6"", standing reach: 8'4"", weight: 207 lbs, body fat: 5.27, wingspan: 6'7"", 3/4 court sprint 3""17, vertical jump: 1'9"", vertical jump free: 3'0""

Giovanni Conte 9/5/11"
"Strengths: Talented shooting guard with a prototypical skill-set for the position ... Strong build ... Has solid size, standing about 6'4"" in shoes with a 6'7"" wingspan ... A good overall athlete with good quickness and speed for his position ... Isn't terribly explosive, but finishes strong around the rim regardless ... A gifted jump-shooter ... Effortless mechanics with a buttery release and a consistent follow-through ... Doesn't need a lot of time to get squared-up to the hoop ... Dangerous in spot-up situations ... Has to be constantly monitored by the defense, especially when he camps in the corner ... NBA range ... Won't hesitate firing out to about 25 feet ... Good quickness and shows a nice first step, so his driving ability can and should improve ... Willing to take the ball inside when the defense overplays him on the perimeter ... Gets to the free-throw line at an adequate rate (4.7 attempts per game in 2011-2012) ... Understands how to run the court in transition opportunities; with the ball or without ... Should be able to defend his position at the next level ... Displays strong defensive instincts; moving his feet well and getting a lot of deflections ... Great overall anticipation while defending passing lanes ... Blocked nearly a shot per game in his freshman season ... Rebounds much bigger than his size (pulled down 6.7 per game) … Very high basketball IQ ... Extremely unselfish ... Doesn't have to clog the offense or dominate the basketball to be an effective scorer ... Learned how to effectively move the ball around the court in Billy Donovan's system ... Won't turn 19 years old until draft night ... Still has a lot of room to grow ...

Weaknesses: May be an inch or two shorter than most starting shooting guards in the NBA, and he doesn't have the kind of explosive leaping ability that would compensate ... Is prone to getting his shot blocked when he takes the ball inside ... Struggles in traffic. Size appears to be an issue for him when in around the basket ... Not a polished ball-handler, has yet to show a consistent ability to get to the rim off the dribble from the periemeter ... Won't often look to create for himself or others off the dribble ... Had an inconsistent year behind the arc, shooting only 34% from outside, struggled especially early in the year ...

Overall: Beal might not have the ideal size of a starting two-guard in the NBA, but he absolutely has the talent to be a successful starter for a long time ... His game would flourish on a team with a good pass-first point guard and another established scorer on the roster ... Shouldn't fall out of the top-10 on draft night and could sneak up a few spots if he measures better than expected at the combine ..."
"Strengths: Standing a legit 6’10 240 lbs with a long wingspan, James has the look of a guy who can play PF or C in todays NBA…A southpaw…Pretty strong player who doesn’t back down from physical play…Also is an NBA caliber athlete, who shows good leaping skills and explosiveness and adequate ability to run as well…His standout traits lie in his defensive ability…One of the very best post defenders in the 2012 draft…Is a high-level shot-blocker, who has outstanding timing as well…Rarely bites on pump &$#%#&@!es, which is one of the more impressive things about him as a rim protector…Also not foul prone at all for the defensive stalwart that he has proven to be…A guy all slashers should locate on helpside defense…Pretty good on-ball post defender as well, with the size and strength to deny post position effectively…Has made life tough for a number of big man prospects during his 2 years at Florida State…Has the size and length to hedge screens well potentially, especially against smaller guards, if his coach doesn’t play a scheme that doesn’t require bigs to switch in pick and roll action…Effective and usually strong finisher on dump-offs…Doesnt get a lot of touches offensively, but just about all of them are high percentage looks…His left hand jump hook is his go-to move, and he is reasonably effective with it...Solid rebounder, but particularly good offensively…Probably has the most interesting story of any of the prospects in the 2012 draft…Dropped out of HS at 16, later returned to get his GED, and then was in the Air Force for 6 years before he played at FSU as a 27 year old…His unique story explains why he could be ready to contribute to an NBA sooner than many rookies, and he has a maturity advantage over nearly every prospect in the draft…Could be a big fan favorite

Weaknesses: James biggest weakness is his ability to contribute offensively…Not ever going to be more than a 5th option scorer, and lacks in nearly every area on the offensive end…His post game, outside of his jump hook is non-existant…Wont be a guy teams throw the ball to in the post with the expectation of him making a crafty move to score…Lacks fluidity with the ball in his hands…Very predictable when playing with his back to the basket, and can be neutralized by bigs with size…Makes no use of his right (weak) hand...Non-existent jump shot, and would be a better offensive threat if he developed a 15 ft game…Sometimes take too long to explode when gathering around the rim when contested, and can be susceptible to having his shot altered do to how long it takes him to go up…Lacking a bit in his footwork and lower body strength…Doesn’t have the best hands, and will bobble passes that hit his hands…Doesn’t rebound on the defensive end as well as a big man who sorely lacks offensive skill usually does…Not likely to pass the ball, mostly due to his role though…Struggled at times when FSU made him switch in pick and roll defense around the perimeter, and is a bit stiff in his movements laterally…Doesn’t play with much knee bend, thus struggling when trying to contain quick stretch PF’s, and may need to switch to C full-time where his matchups are less likely to face him up and attack him off the bounce…Given his advanced age, there are going to be major concerns about his ability to show a lot of improvement…Clearly has a lot of learning to do about the game, given that he hasn’t been playing organized basketball at a high level for very long… Not a guy to trust much at the foul line at all (50% as a Sr from the charity stripe

Overall: James is a really good post defender, arguably the best in the NCAA these past 2 seasons at FSU….He isn’t going to provide much offense at all, but his value is on D…He has the length, athleticism, and energy to be a really good defender against back to basket frontline players…The age issue is somewhat alarming, considering he doesn’t have much time to improve, but he has some NBA ready qualities if a team looks over his lagging offense….Has a great resume’ against some top level opponents ...

Jorrye Nixon 6/18/12"
"Strengths: Waiters' style of play reflects your prototypical combo-guard ... At 6'4 with a strong physical foundation, Waiters can play both on and off the ball throughout stretches of a game ... He's a scorer at heart, but his ability to create off the dribble results in open looks for teammates, which Waiters is capable of finding as a passer ... Always looking to get out in transition, he can change directions off the bounce, effectively absorb and deflect contact and finish at the rim ... Uses screens well off the dribble, recognizes when to hesitate and accelerate over the top ... He's an above average shooter with NBA range ... Comfortable shooting off the dribble inside the arch and via catch and release outside the arch ... Athleticism allows him to penetrate the heart of the defense, where he's illustrated a soft touch on his floater ... Defensively he has active hands and quick feet, and is a constant threat to steal the ball when defending a loose/careless handle ... Often comes out of nowhere for pokes and swipes as an off-ball defender ...

Weaknesses: He's clearly not a point guard, so you wonder how he'll perform offensively against athletic 6'6 NBA 2-guards ... Would see a huge rise in stock if he can learn to facilitate in the halfcourt as a quarterback ... Struggles at times creating good shots in the halfcourt ... With his athleticism and bounce off the dribble, paired with the ability to explosively elevate, Waiters should attack the rim more often (only attempts 2.5 free throws per game) ... Needs to improve as a free throw shooter in general (only 70%) ... Playing at the top of the zone, he hasn't had the experience defending prolific 1s or 2s in isolation... 

Overall: Waiters definitely has a future in the NBA playing the same role he does in college ... He's a spark off the bench, can spell your point guard and spread the floor as a spot-up shooter ... In only 22 minutes of action, he racks up 13 points, 3 assists, 2.3 steals on an impressive 52% shooting ... With Scoop Jardine and Kris Joseph graduating, Waiters will have the chance to maximize his value as a junior, with late lottery not an unrealistic goal/landing range

"Strengths: Crowder is a blue collar combo forward who uses his smarts and ability to be a matchup ploy very effectively … Very compact and strong build…Really gets the most out of himself, and always plays to his strengths … Extremely productive in his 2 seasons at Marquette and emerged as the Big East Player of the Year as a Sr … Really rounded player on the offensive end, and contributes in multiple ways … Projects best as a face-up tweener forward who can use his strength to bully smaller matchups, and his solid quickness to beat slower matchups … High motor player who is adept at finding slips in the D, for quality shots … Understands how to use the glass, and has a soft touch around the rim … Does a great job of using the backboard, rim or net to shield the ball from shot-blockers, a skill that comes in handy for undersized players … Has legit range to 23 ft. when facing up, and is consistent when room and his feet set … Does not need the ball in his hands for long to be effective … Very smart passer, and had a 1.7 A:TO as a Sr., an outstanding rate for a frontline player … Has a knack for playing hard, but also not playing reckless … Has a post game and likes to flip his shoulder and use his turnaround jumper when he has his back to the basket … Runs the floor with a purpose and is a transition threat … When he plays above the rim, he finishes with power … Extremely effective offensive rebounder … Pretty decisive player, usually makes quick decisions … An effort defender ... Not afraid to sacrifice his body defensively and will draw charges … Pretty unique prospect who has fan favorite type potential … Described as a hard worker, and is a classic overachiever ...

Weaknesses: Crowder is going to be a bit limited as a prospect due to his below par physical tools … At 6’5 and playing a game better suited for a frontline guy as opposed to a wing, Crowder will have to continue to work hard to prove he belongs and figure out what position he’s best suited for … Not a standout athlete at all, which is a tad concerning at his size … Noticeably less effective when defended by athletic frontline players with length … Not going to beat many players off the dribble, and is a shaky ball-handler who rarely strays outside of basic straight line drives when slashing … Doesn’t project to be an accomplished man-to-man defender in the NBA … Taller PF’s will get shots off over him fairly easily, and quicker PF’s will be able to get steps on him when driving quite a bit … Could see a higher number of his shots blocked than average when he operates down low … Pretty reliant on other teammates to score … Many think he’ll have to transition to the wing a bit more than he did at Marquette, but doesn’t quite have the athleticism to play extended time out there on a nightly basis … Gets by a lot on effort and fundamentals, but will need strong team defense to not be out of place on defense … Not at all a shot blocker and doesn’t have the tools to be much of a threat getting steals either ...

Overall: Crowder is the classic overachiever who works his butt off, and gets everything he possibly can out of himself … Skill level is better than most players who play as hard as he does, and it’s really crazy that he was as productive and as efficient as he was this past year with the physical and athletic limitations he has … He’s short and not particularly agile or explosive, but he’s so smart he’s effective ... Also isn’t gonna need the ball to have an impact as a role player … Should garner plenty of looks in the 2nd round ...

"Strengths: High-motor forward that possesses the power/athleticism combination to be an effective player in the NBA ... Explosive leaper ... Doesn't waste any time collecting himself when he catches the ball around the rim ... Great size for a power forward ... Has tremendous length with a 7'1"" wingspan ... Strong -- though not bulky -- frame that can generate a lot of power in a hurry ... Very fluid runner ... Quick feet in the paint ... Is efficient and decisive in post-up situations, despite not being especially skilled with his back to the basket ... Aggressive mentality leads to a high number of free-throw attempts ... Has developed a solid right-handed hook shot that's become his go-to move from the left block ... A solid jump shooter, that is more than willing to take advantage of a defense that leaves him open ... A ferocious rebounder (averaged 11.9 rebounds per game in his senior season, good for second in the nation) ... Is particularly adept at chasing down his own misses ... Not afraid to wrestle with bigger players for better position ... Is active and athletic enough to rebound well out of his area ... Has all the tools to defend his position at a high level in the NBA ... Despite not being a very intimidating shot-blocker, he has been an effective defender against post-up situations ... Moves his feet well enough to stay in front of the more mobile power forwards in the NBA ... Hard worker that has improved noticeably every year at school ...

Weaknesses: Doesn't excel at any one area offensively ... His moves in the post are limited, and he's not as likely to get away with relying on his physical tools so much in the NBA ... His shooting ability has potential, but isn't consistent yet ... Won't block or alter a ton of shots ... Can play out of control at times ... Averaged 2.7 turnovers per game in his junior season, which is a pretty high number for a post player ...

Overall: Robinson is one of the safer picks around the top of the draft ... He has the tools and the work ethic to become an ideal pick-and-roll/pick-and-pop kind of power forward ... Once Robinson polishes his post moves and jump shot, he should be a fixture in a team's starting lineup for a long time ... A likely top-5 pick ...

"Strengths: The ultimate ""Glue Guy"", Green's strongest asset is his ability to contribute across the board ... He has a substantial wingspan with a strong frame, and is unafraid to bang with bigger bodies ... Good-looking shooter when his feet are set and he catches/releases in rhythm ... Can stretch the floor with NBA 3-point range ... His vision, passing and ability to facilitate out of the post make it difficult for off-ball defenders to keep their eyes on their man and the ball at the same time ... Reliable mid-range jumper ... Green is slippery with his back to the basket, with the ability to spin baseline or turn across the lane for the finish ... Terrific rebounder thanks to the combination of an aggressive motor and soft hands ... Unselfish and timely passer ... Overachiever. High basketball IQ ... Makes those around him better, possesses sense of maturity and leadership qualities ... 

Weaknesses: One of those great college basketball players that doesn't excel in any one particular area ... Tweener, undersized for a physical forward yet lacks the athleticism of a wing ... Lacks explosiveness, agility, elusiveness and quickness off the bounce ... Under the rim finisher, which is troublesome when you consider his size ... Not a threat to shake his defender off the dribble ... Minimal upside ... Vulnerable defending quicker guards on the perimeter ... Could stand to drop some weight ...

Overall: The Big-Ten Player of the Year, Green has a number of likeable qualities, but not one specific skill that a team may be seeking ... He's a low-risk/low-reward pick considering his role-player potential and ability to fit in ... His ceiling dances around the mid-20s, where a playoff can use him right away to compliment its better players ...

"Weaknesses: Not a true point guard ... Looks for his own shot first, which is expected for a player with his talent in the Big Sky, but will leave scouts questioning whether he'll be able to make his teammates better at the next level ... Has improved his decision-making over the last few years, but can get carried away and take questionable shots when he gets hot ... Has been dominating all season, but hasn't faced very strong competition ...Missed an entire season before his junior year, so some thought has to be made about injury concerns ..."
"Notes: Measured 6'5 (in shoes) 231 lbs, with a 6'11 wingspan at the 2011 Kevin Durant Skills Academy."
"Strengths: Barnes fits the NBA small forward mold, standing 6'8 with substantial length, mobility and athleticism ... Fluid, confident and reliable in catch and shoot situations with NBA range. His ability to spot up and knock down shots will likely give him a long and prosperous NBA career ... He's crisp in the midrange with precise footwork and a high release on his jumper... Effective pulling up off one dribble or two ... Uses pump fakes efficiently to get open looks ... Maintains balance and body control when attacking the rim both on and off the ball ... Has the ability to make difficult shots from different spots on the floor ... Willing passer ... Can get out and finish in transition ... High basketball IQ and a high character individual ... Has the tools to be an effective defender ...

Weaknesses: Offensively Barnes' most glaring weakness surrounds his inability to create easy shots for himself ... His inability to create stems from his lack of an explosive first step ... He's also a work in progress playing on the perimeter since most of his high school career he was a post player ... Most of his damage is done on the perimeter, where he struggles to move north/south and attack the rim off the dribble ... Too one-dimensional, and hasn't added an aggressive go-to move from one year to the next ... If his outside stroke is off, he has the tendency to disappear and become a non-factor in the game ... Physically he lacks the explosiveness to finish at the rim with consistency or ease ... Tends to rely on athleticism and shy away from contact on the interior ... Too upright defensively making him easy to get by ... Generally inconsistent which is enigmatic considering his talents ... Needs to add bulk and become more aggressive ... He was a no-show in UNC's final 2 tournament games, which could leave a bad taste in a scouts mouths ... 

Overall: No one's stock was damaged more by Kendall Marshall's injury than Harrison Barnes, whose inability to create shots for himself was exposed ... The microscope has been focused on Barnes after choosing to return for his sophomore year... Barnes has a high basement, in that worst case scenario he serves as an outside threat that can slash and defend ... He's proven that his game is better suited complimenting a top scoring option then being one himself ... Still, he has the potential to become a team's fixture at the 3 if his ceiling is reached ...

"Strengths: Athletic forward that can clean up for his teammates on the offensive end of the floor ... Extremely explosive ... Gets off the ground in a hurry ... Quick feet around the rim ... Runs the court well ... One of the most active post players in the nation ... Tries to finish everything with a powerful dunk (almost 40% of his field goals made were via dunks) ... Very efficient (shot 57.7% from the field in his senior season) because of his dunk rate ... Plays well off of his teammates ... Understands how to seal off his opponent in the post, creating an opportunity to collect a simple entry pass and finish at the rim ... Thrives on broken plays ... Creates and takes advantage of a lot of second chances via offensive rebounds ... Cuts very well off the ball ... Exciting finisher in transition opportunities, due to his aggressiveness and athleticism ... Surprisingly good free-throw shooter (78.2% his senior season) ... Uses length and energy to get a lot of deflections defensively ... Good shot-blocker (1.8 blocks per game) ... Has a huge wingspan which allows him to play bigger than his actual size ... 

Weaknesses: Standing 6'6"", he lacks ideal size for a power forward at the next level ... Doesn't have the kind of bulk that would help compensate ... Has displayed no perimeter skills that would warrant a shift to the small forward position in the future ... An underwhelming rebounder, especially defensively ... His potential as a rebounder would appear to be even more limited at the next level, because of his lack of size ... Jump shot has a very slow and awkward-looking release ... Gets over-aggressive on both ends of the court and finds himself in foul trouble a lot ... No reliable go-to scoring moves ...

Overall: Acy is a hard guy to peg, because outside of his athleticism, he really doesn't project to be above average at anything in the NBA ... A team looking for an energy player to come off the bench might be interested in selecting him in the second round …

"Strengths: Solid ball-handler ...Very good court vision, finding teammates off P&R, or fast break ... Runs the lane well in transition with ability to spot up on the wing or finish a lob ... Lacks a conscience. Possessing irrational confidence at times, allowing him to play at a high level without perceived nerves or anxiety in high-pressure situations ... Long and active defender on-ball ... Excellent pass denial. ... Capable help defender, proven through passing lane deflections and weak-side shot blocks ... Great footwork in the face-up game, mostly showcasing pump-fake, one dribble pull up/step-back ... Good 3pt and mid range shooter ... Shot has good lift and form ... Exciting dunker in traffic or off lobs, with exceptional contortion abilities and body control in the air ... Length and ball instincts make him a great rebounder for a guard ...

Weaknesses: Despite his confidence, can seemingly get lost in the flow of the game at times ... Needs to further develop explosive first step, to use quickness to his advantage ... Must improve finishing at the rim on non-dunks ...Will need to develop counters to offensive wing moves ... Plenty of space to bulk up frame ... Continue to build on the beginnings of post-game he flashed ... Shot selection can lead him astray at times ... Can benefit from veteran support/mid-first round selection to help add seasoning ...

Notes: Leaves University of Washington after two seasons of exciting moments, dominating stretches, and occasional silent spurts ... All PAC-12 selection as a sophomore ... Got better as season went on, averaging 25 ppg in UW NIT Semifinal run ... High school teammate of Terrence Jones"
"Strengths: An incredibly skilled prospect, Miller has ideal size and a ridiculously lengthy (7'3) wingspan for a scoring small forward ... Displays precise footwork, making every step a purposeful one ... Despite previous ACL surgery, Miller is a mobile athlete that can slip and slide off his defender ... With the ball in his hands, Miller is a crafty shot-creator on the perimeter, doing most of his offensive damage in the midrange ... Uses impressive handle on the ball to create shots off the dribble on the perimeter, showing a high awareness of his defender's positioning and an understanding of how to take advantage of that ... Possesses balance after using effective pivots to get his shot off ... Effectively uses off-ball screens to get open ... As a finisher and scorer down low, Miller's scoring instincts allow him to convert in a number of different ways despite lacking the strength and explosiveness to get easier buckets ... Mentally tough , competitor ..."

"Strengths: Middleton is a late blooming prospect with solid size for a SF at 6’7 210, and he’s still growing into his body…Silky smooth operator on offense, and can score effectively at all 3 levels…Has a sweet jump shot…Soft touch, and is consistent out to about 22 feet and shows raw NBA range…Able to make shots off screens, spotting up or off the dribble…Functional in the triple threat…Likes to operate in the mid-range area, most comfortable from 15-18 feet, and utilizes a nice pull-up game and an interesting blend of runners in his arsenal…Middleton can stick the 3 ball with his feet set, and he has the release speed and form to get his shot off against contests effectively…Plays the game at his own pace, and has a very unique and unorthodox style of play…Very unselfish and won’t go outside of the offense to get his own shots or production very often, which will benefit his eventual transition to the pros…Doesn’t need to dominate the ball at all to make his presence felt on the court…Nice passing skills…Will contribute some on the glass…Appears to be very coachable, and he still has upside remaining as he get stronger and fills out his frame…"
"Strengths: A dynamic scorer that can effortlessly create offense for himself off the dribble ... Has solid size for either guard position ... Recently measured 6'5"" in shoes with a 6'7"" wingspan ... Very quick with the ball in his hands ... Has an extremely quick first step and the ball-handling ability to take advantage of it ... Solid athlete, though he isn't the type to play above the rim ... Is more of a long jumper than a high jumper ... Surprisingly adaptive in the air ... Shows good body control despite smallish frame ... Confident shooter with range that extends beyond the NBA three-point line ... Quick trigger on the perimeter and doesn't need a lot of space to get a good shot off ... Shoots very well off the dribble or out of the triple-threat position ... Very smooth ball-handling ability ... Tough to stop in isolation situations ... Excels at breaking down defenses with sharp and consecutive changes in speed and/or direction ... Chases contact ... Gets opposing big men in foul trouble and shoots a decent amount of free-throws (5.4 free-throws attempted per game) ... Plays very well in pick-and-roll situations ... Knows how to read and exploit the reactions of screened defenders ... Is not afraid of pressure situations ... Burned North Carolina earlier in the season with a deep game-winning three-pointer over the outstretched arm of center Tyler Zeller ... Supremely confident ... Plays with intensity on the floor ... Can be an effective defender when he actually gets low in his stance and bodies-up his man ... It isn't uncommon to see him dramatically improve his defensive posture (and subsequently, his defensive effectiveness) late in close games ... Comes from an NBA family ... Father is ex-NBA point guard and current NBA coach Doc Rivers ...

Weaknesses: Is highly ball-dominant ... Will likely need a team to be tailored around his ability to create off the dribble in order to play up to his potential offensively ... Not a true point guard ... Can get over-aggressive and mistake-prone at times when looking to get to the basket ... Averaged 2.3 turnovers per game during his freshman season at Duke, against only 2.1 assists ... While he can penetrate with the best of them, he currently lacks the sheer vision of a primary facilitator ... Has done a good job of adding muscle to his thin frame, but needs to continue to become stronger ... While he's a creative finisher, he also has a tendency to rush shots around the rim ... Shot 65.8% from the stripe, which is a very disappointing number for somebody that creates as much contact as Rivers does ... Effort is usually underwhelming defensively ... Doesn't collect a ton of steals ... Has been criticized for having a bit of an ego, though many people believe that this added confidence makes him a more dangerous player ...

Overall: Rivers is an exciting prospect and a potentially electric offensive player at the next level ... However, there are a number of concerns about his ability to adapt to the NBA ... He hasn't yet proven that he can be an effective player without dominating the ball and he hasn't yet shown the vision that most teams would feel comfortable with in a starting point guard ... A team in the lottery will most likely be willing to take a chance on him though, regardless of his positional concerns ...

Tyler Ingle 6/14/12"
"Strengths: Wiry thin swingman at 6’6 with tremendous length ... Production increased exponentially from freshman to sophomore campaigns ... Versatile and creative scorer without a distinct offensive pattern (18 PPG). Lethal in the mid-range shooting off the dribble ... Quick trigger. Effortless range from downtown, strong wrists ... Consistency from deep on the incline (35%) from standstill and utilizing screens ... High percentage of drives/slashes to the basket result in a floater or short jumper, both of which he is adept at converting ... Soft touch gives the ball a chance when hitting the rim, gets many friendly rolls ... Look no further than his 51% field goals to assess advancements in shot selection ... Overall decision making has been cultivated in a short time frame ... Plays with a newfound patience- probing the defense and seeking out a high-quality look for himself or a teammate ... Herky jerky off the dribble repertoire, hesitation dribble suits his style ... Possesses a quick first step and long, loping strides ... If he gets past you he’s at the hoop in a hurry ... Able to squirt through small openings in the defense while remaining on balance ... Excellent body control around the rim. Ability to suspend himself in air allows for sublime body contortions ... Creates unconventional angles due to exceptionally long arms. Above average athlete ... Excels in transition where he gobbles up ground and is a strong two-footed leaper ... Premiere rebounding guard in the country (8 RPG) that results in instant fast break opportunities, due to his ability to take the ball coast to coast ... Nose for the rock. Spent more time with the ball in his hands as a sophomore, showing glimpses of burgeoning passing skills and court vision (2.9 APG) ... Disruptive weapon defensively (1.4 SPG & 0.7 BPG). Can guard positions 1-3 with his length and fluid lateral movements ... A great kid, charismatic individual with an infectious personality ... 

Weaknesses: Must get stronger. Classification as “thin” is an understatement. Body type doesn’t suggest he can add weight comfortably. Avoids contact and physical encounters at the rim- struggles to finish through a bump ... A slight bump when off balance can send him reeling ... Gets to the free throw line due to awkward style more so than consistent aggression (5 attempts per game) ... Lacks elite level explosiveness ... Despite improvements in shot selection and decision making (2.8 TO), momentary lapses of reason still invade his game ... Has a tendency to settle, particularly in physical matchups ... At times displays a lack of confidence in his handle, picking up his dribble unnecessarily when unable to beat his defender ... Off the dribble variety is not a staple. His natural feel for putting the ball in the hoop is absent in the remainder of his offensive skill package ... While shooting range is not in question, consistency is ... Doesn’t use his base or get much elevation on his jumper ... Adjustment to complimentary part status will be integral, playing off the ball and not dominating it. Does he have the strength to guard opposing 2’s and 3’s in the league? Likely to be bullied by power guards and wings ... It’s difficult to define how his skill sets translate to the next level, as Barton is a unique player without a clear-cut role ... He's also a year old for his grade, born January 1991, so that must be taken into account when guaging his potential ... 

Notes: Some skinnier players such as Rip Hamilton and Tayshaun Prince have had productive NBA careers but numerous skinny players such as James White have failed to live up to their potential. How much his bad frame (narrow shoulders and hips) and lack of physical strength will inhibit Barton's effectiveness remains to be seen ...

"Strengths: Fluid, athletic 7-footer with developing all-around skills ... Excellent length on a good frame that will be capable of supporting more muscle ... Quick off his feet ... Strong body-control for a big ... Easy alley-oop target ... Explosiveness helps him blow by slower post players in transition ... Good offensive awareness ... Talented passer with good court-vision ... Does a lot of damage in the post at this level ... Willing to wrestle for good position near the block ... Uses his agility well to get around the rim, and is a quality finisher due to his athleticism ... Becoming a better outside shooter, and is dangerous when left alone from 12-18 feet ... Nice touch from the free-throw line; shouldn't be a liability there in the future ... Sells contact well (he's a good flopper) ... Defends with his body more than his hands ... Protects the rim well on defense ... Blocks a lot of shots ... Smart help-defender ... Gets his hands on a lot of rebounds, and is aware enough to tip-out to teammates when he can't corral one himself ... Usually does a good job of finding somebody to box-out whenever a shot goes up ...

Weaknesses:  Will need to add more weight to be comfortable against NBA-caliber centers ... Lacks a real go-to move offensively, though he can do a number of different things well ... Inconsistent motor ... Has a habit of floating around the perimeter a little more than he should ... Can be turnover prone when attempting to put the ball on the floor ... Needs to continue to gain confidence and consistency.

Outlook:  Leonard is a very nice prospect for the center position in the NBA ... Has really blossomed in his sophomore year and is just hitting his stride and was not a big factor in his freshman season ... There really aren't a lot of weaknesses in his game ... He should look to establish an offensive identity and continue to polish his all-around game ... With his potential, he's sure to get some looks in the lottery ...

"Strengths: Talented guard prospect coming off of a breakout season ... Great size for a point guard, standing about 6'3"" in shoes … Solid, aggressive athlete ... Puts a lot of pressure on the defense by pushing the ball up the court and attacking the rim ... Very quick with the ball in his hands ... Difficult to try to stay in front of ... Because of his quickness and aggressive playing style, he gets to the free-throw line at a good rate (5.1 free-throws attempted per game in 2011-2012) ...

Is comfortable pulling-up from both mid and long-range ... Good perimeter defender ... Moves his feet well and works hard to keep his man in front of him ... Not a bad passer ... Proved he was capable of playing a good two-man game this year with Thomas Robinson ..."
"Strengths: Long and lanky swingman with a nice athletic profile and a good skill-set for the off-guard position ... Good size ... Stands just over 6'5"" in shoes with a 6'11"" wingspan, which gives him great length for the shooting guard position in the NBA ... Great leaping ability ... Gets off the floor quickly ... Has good explosiveness ... Nice quickness, and moves well with or without the ball ... Excellent all-around jump-shooter ... Spots up well off the ball ... Able to shoot comfortably in motion, from either mid-range or on the perimeter ... Should be a very dangerous weapon in an NBA motion offense as somebody that can score consistently off of curls and v-cuts ... Can also shoot off the dribble ... Has a nice step-back move that creates a fair amount of separation ... Due to his length and athleticism, has a high release on his jump shot that is difficult to defend ... Has range out to the NBA three-point line ... Good ball-handling skills that still have the potential to get better ... Has shown the ability to break down defenders off the dribble, especially when driving to his left ... Possesses a nice looking runner that he doesn’t use often, but could turn into an important skill down the road ... Solid defender with a fair amount of potential left in this area ... Good lateral quickness and length makes him difficult to beat off the dribble ... Has been a clutch performer in the past, especially during UConn's national title run in 2011 ... A prospect that should be able to produce right away as somebody that excels playing off the ball, but also has the potential to become better at creating for himself ...

Weaknesses: Very thin at this point ... Added strength should help him finishing through contact in the future ... Doesn't shoot a lot of free-throws (3.6 attempts in 37.2 minutes per game) which is a real shame as he has the athleticism to get to the rim a lot and the touch to convert a high percentage of attempts from the stripe ... Still limited when creating offense for himself ... Most of the turnovers he commits occur due to his inexperience handling the ball ... Strongly favors driving left and is extremely mistake prone when driving right ... Three-point percentage dipped from 36.8% in 2010-2011 to 33.6% in 2011-2012, likely due to the extra attention teams could give him with Kemba Walker having left the team for the NBA ... Effort level is inconsistent defensively ...

Overall: Lamb is a nice combination of production and potential, with all the tools needed to become a great all-around starting shooting guard in the NBA ... Most of his weaknesses are showing improvement and could be polished over the next few years with added experience and a good coaching staff ... With everything Lamb offers, he's unlikely to slip out of the lottery on draft night ...

Great reaction time and anticipation allows his to see plays before they develop ... Extremely high basketball IQ ... Smart defender that is capable of staying in front of his man ... Great size for a point guard, standing 6'4"" ... Might be the best passer in the college game ...

Solid athleticism as well, being pretty explosive as a leaper, and he’s really reactive and quick … Can impact the game defensively in a major way when he’s on the court … Most outstanding trait as a player is his shot-blocking ability, and he swatted about 3 shots a night as a Jr … Has the intriguing ability to block shots with either hand, and shows outstanding reactive leaping skills … Slashers must spot him, or their shot will be in the seats … A factor getting on-ball blocks … Only averaged 1.6 fouls a game as a Jr., and that is truly remarkable for a shot-blocking presence with the freedom he had … Understands how to go up straight in the air for blocks, and doesn’t fall for pump fakes very often … As an overall defender, Henson is also a weapon due to his ability to cover wide ranges on the court … Has more than enough athleticism and length to be a real weapon hedging and even defending smaller players in pick and roll defense … Was able to roam the court for UNC to protect the rim, and was trusted (and usually succeeded) when asked to not allow easy shots around the basket area … Uses his length to deny post entry feeds … Runs the floor very well … Good finishing garbage plays at the hoop … Gets a nice number of dunks and high percentage looks … Is a good alley-oop target, and finishes with explosiveness … Soft hands and doesn’t bobble passes much … Developed a weird-looking, yet effective jump hook that he can get off with both hands, even if his footwork to go with it isn’t consistently there … Understands how to extend himself offensively, and he gets off a good number of his moves despite his narrow frame by being a long strider and seemingly stretching his arms out like a condor … Usually has a quickness advantage on his low post matchups … Shows an improving turnaround jumper over his right shoulder that he likes to use on the extended block from as far out as 12 ft … His counter moves showed promise over the past 2 years as well, showing the ability to use up-and-unders or even pump fakes to get shots around the hoop or get to the foul line … Steadily improving his jumper, and has a growing level of comfort shooting as far out as 18 ft … Quality rebounder, and is an especially effective rebounder offensively … Could be a big pick and roll threat for a PG, as he has the size and athleticism to get a number of quality looks in that style … Plays with a pretty live motor … A hard worker, has put on nearly 40 lbs since his Fr. season, and has rounded his game out very well, especially offensively … Has gotten more aggressive and tough over time … Still getting better, was a 6’2 guard in HS before a huge growth spurt hit just prior to his Jr. year ...

Weaknesses: Henson is thin, with a narrow build that has gotten better but still is weak for an NBA PF … Still has the shoulders of the 6’2 player he was before the growth spurt, and that will be troubling for him as he packs on muscle without losing flexibility and athleticism … NBA PF’s will probably bully him on the block and be able to seal pretty easily on him in post-up situations … His lack of strength would be less pronounced if he played with a lower center of gravity, but he usually is a bit too upright so guys can get in his body … Avoids contact, would much rather use finesse than get physical … Although Henson is a good athlete, he is quirky with his lateral movements due to his long legs and unorthodox footwork … Offensively, Henson has made good strides over the last 3 seasons but he still lacks great polish … Since he will have a tougher time establishing position against NBA bigs, he will need to refine his jumper a bit more … Can stretch and hit shots from mid-range, but he needs consistency and repetition … Doesn’t factor much as a ball-handler, even though his long strides and quickness would make him a slashing threat against most bigger PF’s … Struggles to finish shots with contact ... More likely to get in foul trouble in a physical game…Should improve his fundamentals and awareness on the glass more, as he usually just banks on being athletic and long to get rebounds…Really struggles from the foul line, was a sub-50% FT shooter for his career, showing his still developing shooting touch

Overall: After 2 seasons being an impact player for UNC with his length and athleticism, Henson declared after improving steadily each season he was in college…He is a great shot-blocker and rebounder, who can get you easy buckets off garbage plays too…His strength will always be a question, and his unorthodox style of play offensively surely needs polish…But a team looking for a shot-blocking presence who provides energy and doesn’t get in the way offensively will look at Henson…Still has upside despite spending 3 seasons in college…Probable top 20 pick ...

Jorrye Nixon 6/18/12"
"Strengths: English is an intelligent, 6'5 off-guard who has dramatically improved upon his core strengths as a senior ... One of Kim's most under-valued strengths is his recognition of open space ... His awareness off the ball allows him to occupy the spot on the perimeter that provides him with maximum room and minimal contest in catch and release situations ...As a shooter, English consistently shot around a respectable 37% from downtown over his first three years, but went up to a scorching 45% as a senior ... Off the dribble (Few dribbles the better), English is capable of launching off the bounce, and has the ability to make defenders pay for going under on-ball perimeter screens ... Though not an adept shot-creator, he finds ways to elude defenders and finish when attacking the rim north/south ... Defensively he plays with concentration and intensity, which is all you can ask from someone who lacks strength and explosive athleticism ...

Weaknesses: Physically, English has a skinny frame and underwhelming strength/explosiveness for a shooting guard ... Lacks the length that helps shooting 2s get cleans looks while being defended ... Not much of a shot-creator ... When putting the ball on the floor, English is athletic enough to take it north/south to the rim, but isn't shifty enough off the dribble to his shake his defender east/west ... Can't separate off the dribble, making him a one-dimensional offensive threat as a spot-up shooter ... He could have trouble guarding stronger 2s like Iguadala or Joe Johnson, though he only really projects as an 8th man or so anyway ... Low ceiling prospect...

Overall: Kim's role at the next level will likely be as a specialist, but one that several teams could use when you consider the impact of a reliable three-point threat ... He still needs to put on bulk so he can body up with stronger 2-guards, but with a high basketball IQ and appealing complimentary features, English should land a job from a team looking to support its ball-dominant scorers ... If teams are looking at English, they're not focused on his deficiencies as much as they are focused on maximizing his strengths ...

Jonathan Wasserman 5/29/12"
"Strengths: Harkless passes the eye test at 6'8 with smooth athleticism and great length (wingspan is roughly 7'2) ... His ability to attack the rim from the perimeter gives him a distinct advantage over his defender who is unlikely to share his agility ... Quick first step and comfortable handle and footwork for his size ... He has a great feel for the rim, and can score by hitting off-balance shots at awkward angles ... His jumper has range out to 20 feet, and although he shot poorly from downtown, he has promising mechanics, especially when his feet are set ... He's got a quick second jump: he gets off the ground and reaches the ball before his defender, resulting in tip-ins and rebounds given his length ... Runs the floor like a guard ... Defensively he reads passing lanes extremely well, and frequently gets tips, deflections or blocks playing off the ball ...

Weaknesses: Skill level is still in between the 4 and 3 positions, scoring frequently around the basket due to his length and athleticism ... Harkless struggles to create easy shots for himself in the half court, especially on the perimeter as a shooter ... Pull up off the dribble is not really in his repertoire... Only shot 44%, a low number considering his size and athleticism... Needs to add muscle... Number one task is to improve as a shooter, which will maximize his services playing the 3 ...

Overall: He's a great young talent who probably would have benefited from another year at St. Johns... Still, he has tremendous upside and could be a big-time contributor down the road ... Don't be surprised if he slips into the lottery with some strong individual workouts ...

NBA Comparison: 
"Strengths: Super-intriguing prospect with lottery-level tools and talent ... Thick, powerful and intimidating frame ... Aggressive athlete that likes to attack the rim ... Possesses great speed for someone his size ... Runs the court extremely well, especially with the ball in his hands ... Doesn't have a problem with pulling down a defensive rebound and then leading the fast-break himself ... Remarkable ball-handler ... Doesn't have the loose dribble that a lot of other taller players have ... Sharp crossover that becomes deadly when he picks up some speed ... Passing ability rivals a lot of point guard prospects ... Good awareness of where his teammates are on the court and skilled at delivering the ball to them in a position to score ... Strong area rebounder ... Boxes out well ... Respectable mid-range shooter ... Has the strength and quickness to be an excellent scorer in the post ... Should be an incredibly difficult player to matchup against ... Won't be a great shot-blocker, but has all the tools to defend power forwards well in the NBA ... Led his team in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks during his freshman season ...

Weaknesses: Overall scoring ability is very unrefined, though he's technically still a freshman so you have to allow him some leeway there ... Is not a good long-range shooter ... Shot under 50% from the stripe, which is a major problem considering he spends so much time in control of the ball ... When he picks up a lot of momentum (either in transition or in isolation) he can become very turnover prone ... Conditioning has been a concern ... Is not a true freshman; will be 21 years old by the 2012 draft ... Has had a number of off-court problems in the past, but reports indicate that his attitude has improved greatly ... Was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder in high school, which could lead to any number of problems at the next level and has been mentioned as a major cause for concern by a number of scouts. He has had trouble flying and a report surfaced that he chose to go to Iowa State and not Baylor because he didn't want to fly there. ...

Overall: White is a high risk/high reward prospect if there ever was one ... His development will have to be handled very carefully by whichever team drafts him ... If he's selected by a team that is willing to both be patient and let him play to his strengths, then he very well could be the steal of the draft ...

"Strengths: A true 7 footer with a long build, Zeller has solid height for an NBA C prospect … Added in with his size, Zeller is also a fluid athlete, and is certainly mobile showing some leaping skills, particularly with a head of steam … Runs the floor as well as any C prospect out there, and has a high level of speed for a guy his size … Offensively, Zeller demonstrates the ability to play well down low and already has a right-hand jump hook in his arsenal that he utilizes as a go-to move … Although he only sporadically shows it in UNC’s system, he also has a potentially strong jump shot with 18 foot range when facing the basket … Pretty solid FT shooter for a big man (76% as a Jr.) … Could be a versatile factor in the picking game, as his promising jumper will make him a threat to pop, and his speed and leaping skills will allow him to be an ideal guy to roll to the rim and finish … Shows a soft touch … Possesses all the tools to fare well in an up-tempo style, and has demonstrated that with his production on a fast-paced team like UNC … Will use his quick leaping skills and reflexes to be a strong presence on the offensive glass for 2nd chance opportunities … Not many C prospects have his combination of size, run-jump athleticism, and offensive tools … Has pretty good shot-blocking skills too … Seems to have some untapped potential despite being a Sr ...

Weaknesses: Even though Zeller has good height for the C spot, he certainly doesn’t have very good strength …When he faces strong big men down low, they can easily seal and establish position on him for pretty easy shots … He’s also not the toughest guy down low, and struggles with defensive rebounding and physical play inside on both ends … Has a high center of gravity, and can be pushed out of the post by defenders with leverage … Although he has most of his upside on the offensive end, he’s still a bit raw in his feel for the D and will force shots when kick outs are available … Doesn’t react to double teams very well … Not a particularly selfish player, but Zeller rarely looks to pass the ball back out … Should look to add some left handed moves to his arsenal, as his jump hook is his only truly noteworthy move in the paint … He also should work on being less mechanical in his approach, as he can be turnover prone or get caught in awkward situations at times in the half-court offense … Although his jumper is promising, he’s going to need repetition with it as it hasn’t been utilized a lot during his UNC career ...

Overall: Zeller has the prototypical height, length, run-jump athleticism, and touch of a good C prospect … He also has developing skills offensively as a post and face-up shooter … He will be a good fit in a fast-paced offense … Zeller needs more strength and to play tougher, right now he can be bullied on both ends by physical play in half-court situations … Still, he’s likely a first round draft choice next year and he will be a very key clog in the national frontrunner UNC’s chase for a title ...

"Strengths: Explosive scorer that possesses a wide offensive skill-set ... Good length for either wing position ... Active runner ... Quick feet ... Gets himself squared up to the hoop almost instantly ... Volume shooter ... Attempted just under six threes per game his senior season, and made an impressive 41.6% of them ... Won't have any trouble adjusting to the NBA three-point line ... Likes to spot-up in transition ... Can create his own offense ... Has a deadly step-back jumper that is highly difficult for the defense to contest ... Uses a lot of hesitation moves and pump-fakes to throw off his defender ... Drives strong with either hand, though he prefers to pull-up when driving left (often from the baseline) ... Very active without the ball ... Constantly runs to open spots on the floor, positioning himself to get a good shot off if his teammates pass the ball to him ...

Weaknesses: Not a very strong finisher at the rim, due in large part to his slight frame ... Does most of his scoring outside the paint, so it's hard for him to establish a good scoring rhythm if his shot isn't falling ... Only shot 72.1% from the stripe, which is a disappointing number for somebody that can shoot so well from the field ... Not a black hole, but can get in a score-first/score-second mindset and only look to pass as a last resort ... Needs to improve defensively ... 

Overall: If Murphy can adjust to playing without the ball in his hands so much, then he could be a very serviceable scorer in the NBA ... May be a strong contributor in his rookie season, as his spot-up shooting ability is a skill that could help him wedge his way into a team's rotation right away … A potential sleeper pick, that would offer solid value if he fell into the second round …

"Strengths: Has a really solid, strong body that helps him attacking the rim; he is not so explosive, but his first step allows him to beat opponents off the dribble ... Very crafty offensively. He is a natural talent, and can score in many ways: shooting from three, attacking the basket and spotting up ... Very adept at driving and dishing ... Also has a nice left hand, and can grab rebounds, both in offense and defense ... The trademark to his game is his ability to score clutch baskets. He seems to live for crunch time ... Sees the floor exceptionally well for a 19 year old ... He also is a very difficult defensive assignment because he is always in motion, working hard to get open looks ... Defensively, he has nice position and good foot work, plays smart, not overly aggressive ... Tremendous attitude, work ethic. Willing to put the work in to maximize his abilities ... 

Weaknesses: Plays below the rim. Below average explosiveness will make finishing at the rim a challenge for him in the NBA ... He doesn’t have any great defects, but absolutely needs to improve his three point shot, still too inconsistent to be a threat at the NBA level ... He can do almost everything on the basketball court, but has areas that must be improved upon: he must pass better, shoot with more confidence, finish better ... 

Overall: Became the youngest player in French League history to score more than 20 points ... A player that is very advanced for his age and considered the top International prospect for the 2012 NBA draft ... If he is inserted into a well balanced system, he could have an immediate impact on the game, and could be an important member of a supporting cast ... Fournier will have until June 18th to decide to withdraw or leave his name in this year's NBA draft ... 

Lorenzo Moretti 5/10/12"
Strengths: Long agile bigman with
"Strengths: Highly refined, old school post player in a draft saturated with “potential”. His game is marked by both power and skill. Legitimate low block scorer often working his way into a high quality look (17.5 PPG on 52% FG). Master of positioning at 280 pounds and establishes early. Uses his wide body and derriere to keep defenders locked onto his hip. Tremendous lower body strength pinning his opponents into submission. Aggressively throws his weight around and unafraid to punish those in his path. Thrives on contact. Wide array of post moves on the low block, finishing over either shoulder with either hand. Footwork and understanding of angles are advanced. Soft hands and a feathery touch. Nimble elusivity for his size. He has taken strides in the face-up game, working from the elbow area in space without threat of a double. He’s a dual threat from there, either comfortably popping a mid-range jumper or attacking off the bounce with skilled handle. Quickness is not his ally, but he’s a bull in a china shop. Technically sound jump shot with smooth release. Range has extended to three-point territory, shooting 40% on over 1 attempt per game last season. 77% shooter at the free throw stripe, to which he is a frequent visitor. Strong basketball IQ- reads double teams, finds the open man and rarely get careless with the ball (1.2 AST: 1.9 TO). Excellent anticipation on the glass, clears room with his big frame (9 RPG, 3 Offensive). Intuitive defender with good hands (1.2 steals). Averaged a shade over a block per game last year, a healthy upgrade from 0.5 as a freshman. Added muscle weight and improved conditioning that resulted in more effective minutes at full strength, as well as more explosive movements.

Weaknesses: Lacks the overall physical gifts of other top prospects in the draft class. Appears stuck in glue at times, particularly against long, athletic competition. His space-creating advantage and wide base are nullified. No elevation off the floor and severely limited explosion. Plays beneath the rim. Run the courts laboriously. Lateral quickness is poor- badly exposed in space and on pick and roll switches. Undersized for the center position, a shortcoming he does not make up for in length. Major concerns defensively against new breed, mobile NBA 4’s. Not an intimidating presence on the back line of a defense. Less than a blocked shot per game in conference play, and does not alter attempts either. Averaged more steals than blocks. Position defender. He’s overwhelmed by size, length and athleticism on both sides of the ball. The majority of his dominant efforts came against lesser competition and teams devoid of frontline size. His 5/19 performance in his final collegiate game against Kansas did not aid his draft standing. His body style will always be susceptible to weight issues. Can’t afford to rest on his laurels and be satisfied with current level of conditioning and agility if he wants to remain in the lottery. 

Notes: NBA doctors redflagged his back at the NBA combine. It has severely damaged his draft stock and he's no longer considered a lock for the first round. (added 6/24)

"Strengths: In terms of physical tools, Melo is exactly what you look for in a C prospect … Is a legit 7 footer with a 270 lb frame that could slim down more with added conditioning to around 260 … Could potentially be one of the most physically imposing bigs in the NBA in time … Combined his fantastic size with a 7’3 wingspan that allows him to play even bigger … His main value as a prospect comes from his potential defensively … Improved his conditioning by a mile as a sophomore, and became a huge factor in Syracuse’s vaunted 2-3 zone defensive scheme …Was the Big East Defensive Player of the Year … Could be a huge factor defending the true back to basket C’s in the NBA with more development … Very effective shot-blocking threat, and has potential as a rim protector … Offensively, Melo has a solid jump hook (especially with his right hand) that is near unblockable with his length … Shows flashes of a turnaround jumper when he turns over his left shoulder … Finishes well, when in shape, around the rim … Plays within 5 ft. of the rim the vast majority of the time on offense, with no qualms about it, and that is ideal with his size … Runs the floor well for his size … A factor on simple alley-oop passes from teammates … Underrated passing skills … Has the upside to continue to develop further on both ends ...

Weaknesses: Really not much of a skilled player on the offensive end, and will likely always be a 5th option on the floor … Is a bit too mechanical in and out of his moves and will be contested very easily until he improves that … Keeps things simple on offense, but is sometimes painfully predictable with his moves … Seems to preconceive what he will do with the ball as soon as he gets it without reading the action around him … Has that bad habit many young bigmen do of putting the ball lower than his chest when he gets offensive rebounds or receives entry passes, allowing quick handed guards to get steals or knock the ball free … Needs most of his shots created for him … Doesn’t always play as strong as his imposing size indicates, and can struggle to finish with contact at times … Doesn’t have great hands, and will bobble passes at times that hit his hands … Not a great rebounder, which is concerning for his size … Will have to show that he can play outside of the paint in an NBA that has a defensive 3 second rule … Was able to plant in the paint playing in the Cuse zone and rarely strayed from the immediate paint area, and will have to adjust to a more pick and roll style NBA … Although he runs the floor as well as he can for his size, he still is a lumbering kind of big who is best suited for a team who doesn’t play up-tempo … There are still questions about his conditioning after a forgettable freshman season in which he was sluggish and out of shape for most of the year … Has the frame and physique that needs to be conditioned constantly, as he can get out of shape fairly quickly if he isn’t careful … Has some concerns that will come up during the interview and character evaluation process, including a domestic violence charge and being academically ineligible for the NCAA tournament as a sophomore … At times is a bit hotheaded on the court, getting on himself or the refs too heavily when he makes mistakes … A bit foul prone, but is doing a better job of going straight up when blocking shots … Poor foul line shooter … Has a raw basketball IQ, and is clearly still learning the game ...

Overall: Melo’s physical tools and perceived upside is what he relies on as a prospect … As a true 7’ big, he will get plenty of chances to develop in the NBA … He is an effective shot-blocker and looks like an NBA C right now, but questions remain … He needs a lot of refinement offensively, he must improve his fundamentals defensively: Never stood out as a rebounder at Syracuse. Will he stay in shape. And he also has had a few off-court issues … A team will select him because of his physical tools and youth and he's projected as a likely late first round pick ..."

"Strengths: Another big man from the Turkish camp ... Aldemir is a center with good size and adequate athletic skills ... His footspeed and the coordination of his upperbody make him a very interesting player, ready to play in the NBA ... His main attribute is the propensity to grab rebounds: he has strong instincts for this part of the game ... On offense he lacks a polished one-on-one game, but understands all situations and is always ready for passes ... Another important skill for a big man is his efficiency in free throws, and we can consider him reliable (75% in Euroleague, 51% in Turkish League). On defense he’s also interesting: he’s smart, quick lateral movement and has a sense of timing for blocks ..."
"Strengths: A 6’4 wing coming off a big season for Oregon State, Cunningham declared a year early for the draft … His most well-known trait comes from his athleticism, which is clearly elite … Has strong explosiveness as a leaper, and is pretty quick and fast, but he has a certain smoothness about his athleticism that makes it even more impressive … Has some highlight reel level plays to his name, and is effective using his athleticism to make an impact in different aspects of the game … Seems to hang in the air … Has adequate size for a SG prospect, and more than enough length to be effective as well … Put together pretty well, and is well-defined with a frame that can add weight … Has nice upside on the offensive end ... Able to score very effectively, even with a skill set that needs polish … Has a good understanding of how to move without the ball to get shots … Real good potential as a slasher, and has nice natural ability to get to the hoop … Pretty good ball-handling skills and first step … Looks really smooth in the lane, and shows outstanding body control and fluidity … Nice shooting mechanics, and has the potential to be a pretty respectable spot-up shooter … Electric in transition … Runs the floor extremely well and finishes consistently with a head of steam … Has potential to be a threat for backdoor alley-oops …Watch out for him on the offensive glass, will get above the rim tip-ins if the defense ball-watches on rebounds … Cunningham had the reputation of being an outstanding defender in the Pac-12 the last 2 seasons, and has the tools for that to translate in time ... One of the absolute best ball-thieves in the 2012 draft class, and will jump in passing lanes or use his quick hands to pick a ball-handlers pocket … Top-notch anticipation skills … Has the ability to defend both guard spots effectively … Played some time at PG for Oregon State, and has the ability to play spot time there in the future ... Unselfish player … Draws foul pretty well, especially in transition … Nice overall potential as a scorer ...

Weaknesses: Although Cunningham has adequate size, he is thin and will need to put on a little more weight to deal with the bigger SG’s in the NBA … Needs a lesson is shot selection, and will go too far at times with his jumper off the bounce, where he is inconsistent at best … Doesn’t have a strong mid-range game … Has NBA range on his jumper, and good mechanics, but should look to get more confident with his shot from deep … Will need more repetition with his jumper for it to blossom into the weapon it can be … Gets to the rim reasonably well, but sometimes is a bit loose with his handle and lets the ball slow him down on slashes … Not a great 1-on-1 scorer … Will try and get cute with his finishes around the rim, does not always go up strong against shot-blockers … Sometimes makes bonehead plays, and shows a raw understanding of the game at times … Can get overzealous for steals … Has a habit of getting stagnated by screens, where his thin frame is exposed the most on D …Was productive at OSU, but never made them a winner in the years he was a featured option, despite the Pac-12 being a weaker league in his 3 seasons there … Not a very polished player overall, and will need time to adjust to the NBA ...

Overall: Cunningham’s got some nice potential….He really should polish his game a bit more, but there is potential…He’s a very good athlete, unselfish, has progressed each year as a jump shooter, and he has promise as a slasher….Probably more of a long term prospect than he is ready to contribute to an NBA squad immediately though…Oregon State struggled while he was there, and the Pac 12 hasn’t been a strong league in about 3 years…Still, some team is going to like his upside…There is talk about him possibly going at the end of the 1st round, but he’s a likely 2nd round pick depending on how his workouts go"
"Strengths: A natural small forward, but can also play with his back to the basket, thanks to his physical strength ... He’s an agile player with skills in various parts of the game: he can shoot, dribble and also play off the ball adroitly .... Physically is strong and athletic, so he can be a good rebounder for the position ... He’s very young and lacks experience at a high level, but on the court he shows the composure and confidence of a veteran ...

Weaknesses: His first step is not a strength. On defense he can struggle in the post when he plays power forward, and on the perimeter with the quickness of small forwards ... He has to improve his efficiency on free throws and develop the range and consistency to shoot behind the arc ... 

Notes: An underrated player on the European scene: last year at Valencia (Spain), he didn’t get a chance to play and it dropped him off the radar ... This season he’s playing very well in Belgacom Charleroi, a Belgian team that is in Euroleague ... 2011/12 is the first season that he has played important minutes ...

"Strengths: Great size and strength for a point guard ... Excellent crossover, change of pace dribble, and first step make him near impossible to prevent from reaching the basket ... Finishes well in traffic, while being able to adjust his shot in the air ... His success grew as the season progressed as his finesse layups started to fall ... Always looking to attack and put pressure on the defense, while remaining a very willing passer ... Very good at making the simple pass to open teammates, and great at making the quick pass/lob to cutters, even before they realize they are open ... Active cutter towards the basket when off the ball ... Outstanding offensive rebounder ...When engaged, displays excellent lateral quickness and ball pressure on defense ... Reads passing lanes and anticipates very well out of help-side defense

Weaknesses: Greatly needs to improve spot up and off the dribble jump shot, as well as free throw shooting ... Needs to become a better ball protector and decision maker ... While he has a great feel for the game, added maturity will help in better situational decision making based on time and score ... Thrives more in an uptempo game at this point ... Needs to strengthen dribbling and finishing with right hand ... At times can play overconfident and try to do too much ... 

Notes: In his one collegiate season, Wroten proved to be both spectacular and frustrating ... He won PAC-12 Freshman of the Year and narrowly missed out on PAC-12 Player of the Year ...Will benefit from the spread, open floor nature of the NBA game ...Will need time to develop and mature, but undeniably a first round talent in the draft ... Perceived as baggage-laden by some GMs, which could hurt final draft position ..."
"Strengths: Experienced lefty with a decent skill-set for the shooting guard position in the NBA ... Good open-court speed ... Runs hard in transition ... Uses speed to create easy opportunities for himself ... Solid athlete with good leaping ability ... Makes up in part for his lack of height with a strong, Gilbert Arenas-type frame and a 6'6"" wingspan ... Moves well without the basketball ... Always looking to rotate to an open position on the perimeter where his teammates can find him ... Has been one of the better spot up shooters in college basketball over the last few years ... Also has a deadly step-back jumper, which allows him to create a little space for himself off the dribble if he needs to ... Adequate in isolation situations ... Has a quick first-step and basic ball-handling skills, though he's clearly more comfortable 15-25 feet away from the basket ... Solid defender ... Uses his strength well against bigger players ... Good, unselfish passer ... Generally won't take a lot of bad shots ... High basketball IQ ... Strong leadership qualities ... Has experience playing hard on a winning program with Marquette over the last three years ... A great overall teammate ...

Weaknesses: Only stands 6'2"" and lacks the point guard skills to play the position full-time ... Was uncomfortable around the rim in college, and will likely see even less success there in the NBA against bigger players ... Solid passing ability and he moves the ball well, but he won't (or at least shouldn't) be asked to create for his teammates off the dribble ...

Overall: Johnson-Odom has good role-playing potential in the NBA ... Ideally, he'll play the two-guard off the bench and look to spot-up on the perimeter where his lack of size won't be as much of an issue ... He may struggle defensively (even in this role) but his high basketball IQ, wingspan and strong frame could keep him from being a liability ... If he impresses in workouts and a team believes his catch-and-shoot ability, he could land in the second round ..."
"Strengths: Physical big man with a severely limited skill-set ... Excellent all-around athletic tools ... Very good jumping ability ... Recorded a max vertical leap at the 2012 NBA draft combine of 40.5” ... Good, but not elite-level explosiveness ... Prototypical size for an NBA center (was recently measured at 6'11.75"" in shoes) ... Active offensively ... Cuts well, and is receptive to quick passes in the paint ... Moves his feet remarkably well for a player his size ... Solid touch around the rim ... Has a nice hook shot that can be effective against smaller defenders ... Is very efficient (shot 61% from the field his senior year) ... Knows him limitations and doesn't make a ton of mistakes ... Great rebounder ... Creates a lot of put-back opportunities for himself by crashing the offensive glass ... Uses his leaping ability and length to tip a lot of rebounds to teammates that would have otherwise been out of reach ... Plays with a lot of energy ... Good motor ... Has interesting role-playing potential ...

Weaknesses: Limited offensive potential ... His underwhelming 6.6 points per game average this season was actually the best of his four-year college career ... Doesn't shoot a ton of free-throws (2.2 free-throws attempted per game), and makes a below-average percentage of the few he does take (63%) ... Hasn't shown a consistent jump shot from anywhere outside of eight feet ... Limited move-set in the post, and tends to struggle against bigger players ... Aggressive mentality (especially when chasing loose balls) can get him into foul trouble quickly, though he's managed to cut his foul rate every year since he's been at school ...

Overall: Plumlee doesn't have a lot to offer an NBA team outside of rebounding ... He lacks any means of consistently creating his own offense, or at least any offensive means that he was able to display at Duke ... His physical profile and rebounding ability might be able to get him drafted in the second round if a team is looking for an energetic role-player to hit the boards coming off the bench …"

"NBA Comparison: Jermaine O'Neal/Jason Thompson

Strengths: High-level athlete combo forward with excellent size and length. Versatile offensive skill set to score inside/outside (16.5 PPG). Could be seen as being big enough to play center in today's NBA. He possesses rare agility at 6’11 in tandem with a hunger for activity and relentless motor. Runs the court like a guard, with a fluid gait and long, easy strides. Nightmare matchup for opponents on the interior due to explosive quickness and elevation. Extraordinarily nimble and quick mover in the paint. He has added strength and bulk (225 to 240) without losing that calling card explosiveness. Uses his athleticism to earn high percentage looks (58%), elevating above defenders. Displays a deft touch and equally adept at finishing with his left hand. Electric spin moves in the post over either shoulder, preferring to attack baseline. Body control and hang time to make the appropriate in-air adjustments and alter release after a bump or if impeded. 83% free throw shooter on over 5 attempts (65% as sophomore). Rebounds at will on both the offensive and defensive backboards, ranking amongst the nation’s leaders with 10.8 per game. Quick leaper on multiple jumps while still retaining 1st jump lift. Utilizes his length and mobility to rebound out his direct vicinity. Flourished on the perimeter during his time at UTEP, albeit in a more liberal style of play. Comfortable in the mid-range with the ability to step out behind the three-point stripe. He has the potential to be an effective face-up weapon with a quick first step and long frame. Had a tendency to play in a “rushed state” early in his collegiate career, but has found an efficient pace his junior season. Doesn’t force shots and playing within a more defined role for the betterment of the team. He displays legit lateral quickness and foot speed to defend on the perimeter and not look like a fish out of water. Multiple position defensive adaptability. Mentally and physically a different player since arriving in the SEC.

Weaknesses: Moultrie seems to have transitioned from a SF to PF this season, sacrificing continued perimeter development in the process. Being that he’s not a true post option, he’ll likely see time at both spots on the next level. He’s caught somewhere in between, which can actually be viewed as a strength and serves to illustrate his versatility. Has shown glimpses of range shooting and ball handling aptitude, but more is required for the NBA small forward position. As he exhibited at UTEP, the potential to be a dynamic face up player is very much present. It’s that potential alone, despite his raw attributes that once again has scouts drooling over his package of skills. Not the most technically sound of prospects, relying on his massive (on most nights) talent, size and athletic advantage. Plays too quickly at times (2.2 TO) and must harness his energy. Could still stand to add more bulk, be more accepting of contact and get to the FT line more consistently. When he begins a move, thinks score only. Not selfish, but at the same time not a prudent passer when attracting defensive attention. At 6’11 with his length and leaping ability, it is inexplicable that he hasn’t been able to block a shot per game (0.9) in any of his three seasons. Basketball IQ and awareness on both ends should sharpen with experience. Moultrie has missed three games in 2011-2012 with tendinitis in both knees. 

Notes: The top transfer in the nation. Played FR and So years at UTEP.

Adam Ganeles 1/16/12

Strengths: Late blooming post player with a bright future (young for a sophomore - will be 19 in a week) ... Has an excellent combination of length and agility ... Explosive big who plays above the rim and displays good body control ... Moves exceptionally well for a player his size showing the ability to run the floor like a guard ... Plays a physical game with good strength and willingness to mix it up inside ... Solid offensive game with nice potential. Shows good creativity on post moves using spin moves and up-and-unders and good touch around the basket ... Likes to face the basket and take opponents off the dribble, but can also create with his back to the basket ... Can effectively take opponents off the dribble all the way out past the 3 point line (tremendous foot speed for a 4) ... Effectively utilizes the turnaround hook shot ... Good form on his shot with a solid baseline jumper ... An excellent rebounder (8.2 rpg as a freshman) with quick leaping ability and good length ... Has very quick feet and moves well to cover a lot of ground on rebounds ... Plays with a high motor ... Displays excellent hands, a necessity for quality post players ... Shows the ability to catch and shoot from 3 point range (shot 37 3s converting on 11 as a freshman) ... 

Weaknesses: Should continue to extend range and improve on his outside shooting ... Free throw shooting was surprisingly low for a player who shows solid form (54 FT% needs to improve) ... Can be too enamored at times with facing the basket and neglect his physical strength inside ... Shows solid rebounding ability but could improve with a little more attention to details, boxing out and finding his man and using post position, instead of just relying on his physical attributes ... Not a great passer. Needs to cut down on the turnovers and improve on his a/to ratio ( 0.6 apg to 1.7 to) ... Shows the type of body that will be able to put on strength with no problem but currently (at 230 lbs) could stand to bulk up some ... Considering his size (length) and leaping ability he should be a bigger defensive (shot blocking) presence ... Should be able to double his 0.9 bpg output as a freshman ... 

Notes: Will sit out the 2010-11 season after trasferring from UTEP to Mississippi St. ... Impressed in Aukland, New Zealand at the 2009 U19 Championships as the top (gold medal winning) USA Team post prospect ...

"NBA Comparison:

Strengths: His physique resembles “The Thing”, from Marvel comic books ... He’s another big man from Turkey, not quite as big as Aldemir or Asik, but more bouncy and with more athletic skills ... Late bloomer with apparent potential left to develop .... His body is very strong, with long arms, and so he is a great rebounder with good ability to finish in the paint ... He’s left-handed and surprisingly can shoot out to the three point line ... He played an excellent season in Turkish League, finished with more than 10 points and 6.5 rebs per game ... In 2012 Eurocamp he showed many improvements from last year ...

Weaknesses: Feel for the game remains very raw ... Consistency is not there. Disappears for stretches of games ... Doesn't know how to properly use his size and strength advantage in the post ... His skill level is low for NBA standard. Post moves are remedial ... He is not very effective with his right hand, and he has to improve his efficiency in free throws ...

"Strengths: Unparalleled athleticism, fluidity and mobility for a 6'11 prospect ... Excellent ball-handling skills, can go coast to coast, defensive rebound to transition layup ... Presents a serious mismatch on the perimeter against slower footed big men who lack the lateral quickness to stay in front ... Has promising mechanics on his jump shot, and there's reason to believe it will improve with time ... Has range to knock down 3s but hasn't developed any consistency ... Quickness, agility and leaping ability make him difficult to contain defending off the ball, especially high above the rim... Ability to shake his defender with his back to the basket and get clean, though tough, looks at the rim ... Athleticism allows Jones to avoid defensive contest when attacking and finishing, which he does with style and efficiency... Runs the floor like a guard ... Laterally quick enough to guard hybrid 4s and some 3s on the perimeter depending on matchups ..."
"Strength: Hummel is a prospect who has been on the radar since his Fr. season in 2007-2008…Very experienced player…Pretty good size for a wing prospect at 6’8 with a decent 218 lb frame…Was an impact player immediately upon entering college…Fundamentally sound…A pretty well-rounded offensive player…Played 3 positions (SG,SF,PF) in college, being a very tricky matchup for teams…Is most effective as a jump shooter…Has NBA range…At his best spotting up, but can hit some shots off screens…Has the size and release speed to get shots off effectively…Nice ability to pull-up and hit shots against closeouts…Plays real low mistake basketball, averaged less than a turnover a night as a Sr. in 32 mpg…Nice basic passing and ball-handling skills…Shows some ability to post up, given his experience playing PF…Does a good job rebounding for a player who functioned often as an undersized PF…Willing to work defensively, takes charges and is a pretty assignment savvy…Showed fgood leadership skills in college….Showed great perseverance playing through 2 knee injuries in the same

Weaknesses: Hummel is a low level athlete for NBA standards…His lack of quickness and athleticism limit him on both ends of the floor…Not going to be able to get around guys in the NBA…Wasn’t a very efficient finisher around the rim for a player who was 6’8 and played PF…Will probably struggle to defend NBA SF’s, doesn’t have the lateral quickness to stop the speedy slashers wings…Pretty basic all-around player, not going to make wow plays…His knee injuries are an obvious worry, his had 2 different ACL surgeries and back problems in the past…His knee surgeries have put a damper on his already underwhelming athleticism, and made him somewhat easier to defend…Doesn’t have the size to play PF like he did a lot of the time at Purdue, nor the quickness to be a mismatch

Overall: Hummel was an effective and very efficient player in college for some very well-coached and competitive Purdue teams…He has the jumper and size to be a jump shooter for a team, and he’s smart and willing enough on the defensive end to be masked…A coach could be willing to overlook his lack of athleticism and extensive injury history given his high basketball IQ and ability to be a locker room presence"

"Strengths: Ezeli's intrigue as a prospect stems from his physical tools, where he sports a strong, NBA frame and a monstrous wingspan that hovers around the 7'4 mark ... At 6'11 with his length, he's a space-eater in the paint on both sides of the ball ... His selling point is his ability to protect the rim, which he does extremely well thanks to the combination of agility, strength and length ... Able to contest shots at both the high and low post showing impressive lateral quickness for his size ... Strong post-defender, able to hold his positioning ... Improved his footwork offensively in the post, using an effective drop step to set up an over shoulder hook ... Willing to do the dirty work, defending and rebounding. Does an effective job of using his body to gain position down low ... Strong, reliable finisher at the rim ... Shows comfort and awareness slipping off high screens to the basket on pick and rolls..."
"Strengths: Prototypical center size – a legitimate 7-footer with bulk … Very much an old-school center with a handful of back-to-the-basket post moves ... Has made himself into an outstanding FT shooter (~80% from the line) who is able to get himself to the line consistently. He might be the best FT shooter of any true post player alive … Smart defender and solid shot blocker, relying more on size and positioning than explosiveness when getting blocks … Shown improvement. He’s developed all aspects of his game substantially since arriving at Gonzaga … While not called on to do so often, he has shown an ability to hit a face-up jumper from the 12-15 foot range … Has good lateral quickness on D for a big man which shows in his ability to defend against screens …

Weaknesses: He often plays small, not using his size and strength advantages to bully opponents … Lacks length. Arms appear to be very short for his height ... Not a great leaper; doesn’t explode off the floor … Not a great rebounder for his size, only averaging around ~7 boards a game during his senior year (and that’s a career high) … Should consistently dominate the inferior big men he faces in the WCC, but often doesn’t … Doesn’t use his body to establish deep post position nearly enough … Struggles mightily when double teamed … He doesn’t dunk when he often should. This is due to a combination of keeping the ball low, hesitating, and pump faking too much … Can be inconsistent and disappear for stretches of the game if he’s not receiving touches in the post … 
 
Seth Sommerfeld 1/9/12"
"Strengths:  A “true” PG with a great feel for the game … Charismatic player with the imagination and mindset to become a standout PG at the NBA level , “has a chance to be special”… A facilitator who shows the ability to make those around him better … Great vision and passing skills … Great burst. Has the blow by speed to get past defenders off the dribble … Good decision maker. Looks to make the right play instead of always trying to dazzle … Doesn’t force shots or overdribble (improved this in his limited time at Duke) … Excellent shooter with the ability to get shots within the flow of the offense … Jumpshot has great form … Has range out to NBA three and just needs time to gain consistency on it … Good one on one skills … Can pull up off the dribble … A strong finisher exhibiting good body control … Ambidextrous with the dribble, showing impressive ability to go to the left and finish with his off hand … Has excellent ball handling ability with a nasty crossover … High motor kid who gets strong reviews for his character and work ethic … Has a good wingspan and big hands which are obviously positive attributes … Very efficient shooter : 53% fg, 90% ft, 45% 3p … Solid defender with adequate size. Gets low, fundamental, doesn’t gamble too often. Plays the passing lanes well (1.5 spg) … 

Weaknesses:  Durability is a legitimate concern after he missed all but 8 games of his freshman season (heading into the post season) … The big question is whether this was a fluke (turftoe injury) or indicative of a bigger problem … Lack of experience at the college level is concerning considering how difficult it is to master the position at the next level … Could struggle with the transition to the NBA game with just 8 games of NCAA experience under his belt. Granted he looked advanced for a freshmen PG … Has solid athleticism, but not elite … Not known for highlight reel dunks or a player who overwhelms opponents with his physicality … Needs to continue to work on his strength in order to improve his ability to finish and defensively … Tendency to get out of control attacking the basket … Put up tremendous numbers in his first 8 games, however it’s questionable he would have sustained that for an entire season through conference play … Appears to have the total package but missing such a huge portion of his freshman season makes him a risk. A team will have to roll the dice on limited college experience and exposure …

Notes: Turf toe injury has sidelined him for all but 11 games of his freshman season … When he returned from injury, he looked out of shape and was not as dynamic as he had been in the early part of the season ... Refusing to participate in the athleticism testing (a first for a projected top pick) may raise some red flags ... 10% body fat also extremely high for a guard raising the question whther he has been able to work out fully after returning from injury ... His breakout performance came in a game that many felt were the two top teams in the country, at the time, with 31 points vs. Michigan State. Their collapse has made that performance less impressive in hindsight … The NBA game has gone the way of point guards and having a true PG gives a team such an edge. This plays right into Irving’s hands as he is viewed as a true point guard with the potential to be just a notch below the games elite’s (Derrick Rose, Deron Williams, Chris Paul)… Sources claim he will enter this year’s (2011) NBA draft if he’s projected by teams as a top 2 pick …

"Strenghts: Bojan Bogdanovic is a versatile player who can score in lots of different ways. He has a good combination of height and body frame that should allow him to compete with NBA small forwards physically ... He can attack the rim effectively with his quick first step, which allows him to beat his immediate defender quite easily ... His mid-range game is a continuous threat because he has a good pull up jumper with confidence ... He has NBA range on his 3-point shot, and is becoming more adept at putting the ball on the floor and getting to the basket ...

Weaknesses: He’s an average athlete by NBA standards and he lacks lateral quickness ... For these reasons he could struggle against NBA SG and SF on the defensive side ... Even if he has a complete offensive game he doesn’t excel in any specific area, limiting his effectiveness for the NBA ... Furthermore he is 22, so his upside is limited compared to other players ...

Overall: Bogdanovic, during the 2010/2011 Euroleague season averaged 18 points, with a career high of 28 against Barcelona, showing his ability as a complete and versatile scorer ... His athletic shortcomings and his recent signing with Fenerbache Istanbul has effectively withdrawn his consideration from the first round, but he’s still an intriguing pick as a second rounder ..."
NBA Comparison: David West/Michael Beasley
"NBA Comparison: Vladimir Radmanovic/Channing Frye

Strengths: Combo forward with excellent length, agility and shooting ability … His ability to knock down shots is his bread and butter … Has a fluid stroke with range out to NBA 3 … A quality spot up shooter who gets his feet set and releases the ball in good speed for a 6-10 forward … Has been on an absolute tear shooting 49% from 3 on a high volume of shots as a senior … Likes to roam around the perimeter, gain possession of the ball and face the basket … Utilizes his excellent foot speed well to beat defenders … Proficient at getting defenders off balance with a pump fake/jab step and then blowing by them and getting to the rim using the dribble … His quickness and shooting ability makes him excellent in pick and pop situations … Quality free throw shooter at over 80% … Has an effective righty jump hook he uses when he spins right … Can create shots off the dribble and uses a spin move and polished fade away jumper … Handles the ball well for a 4 … 

Weaknesses: Lacks a true position: Despite having excellent speed and agility, he’s a bit of a tweener lacking the bulk to defend post players and the lateral speed to defend quick 3s … Gets pushed off the block far too easily … Needs to bulk up and become a full time power forward … May not have the frame to put on considerable weight comfortably … Back to the basket skills are underutilized. Usually will post up but then face the basket and isolate and use the dribble to beat defenders instead of maintaining low post position, keeping the ball high, and scoring via post moves … Playing at Richmond doesn’t help to convince scouts that he can compete against top tier talent at the same high level consistently … Rebounding ability would benefit from more leg and upperbody strength …

"Strengths: An experienced champion and winner at the college level, Singler has as impressive a resume’ as any prospect in this class … A 4-year starter who was an impact player at Duke as soon as he put on the uniform … At 6’9 and the 228 lb frame he has worked hard on, he has good size for the SF spot he’ll likely occupy for year to come at the NBA level … Very unselfish player who acceted and understood his role at Duke and played it beautifully … Has an effective jump shot with soft touch and the height and release to get it off easily … Is effective off screens and in transition with his shot … High IQ player, who is good at finding openings and usually makes smart decisions when he has the ball … Displays adequate passing and ball-handling skills … Highly competitive, and plays with good intensity and energy … Not a bad rebounder on the wing ...

Weaknesses: Singler could struggle with his below average athleticism at the next level … Will struggle on D, and will have to do little things like take charges and hustle hard to not be a complete non-factor on that end … Is pretty stiff laterally, and can be blown by off the bounce, even by players with middling athleticism … Scouts waited 4 years for Singler to emerge into an elite shooter, but he never did and was largely just decent … Struggled particularly badly with his shot as a Sr. (32% from 3-point range) … Misses too many open shots to be considered a pure shooter, and is prone to long stretches of inefficient shooting … Wasn’t overly effective as a slasher at Duke and struggled badly finishing around the rim, so that problem will be compounded against NBA defenders … For someone with his experience and IQ, putting up more assists than turnovers in 3 of his 4 years in college is a concern … Plays below the rim … Singler tunred 23 on May 4th further limiting his upside as he's a year older than the average senior ... 

Overall: Singler has the winning resume’ and the size to garner first round consideration … He is a well-known commodity and teams probably were higher on him during last years draft … Still, his disappointing Sr. season (especially as a shooter), his lack of athleticism and his probable struggles on D raised some doubt on where he is going to be picked and how effective he’ll be at the next level … It's safe to say, he probably would’ve been much better off declaring last year ...

Jorrye Nixon 6/10/11"
"Strengths: A lefty post player with a tremendous wingspan … He has made improvements to his body, shedding the baby fat he carried throughout high-school, he has also added some mass and definition (his frame shows the potential to support even more weight without taking away from his explosiveness) … A good athlete, he is able to make plays on both ends of the floor thanks to his length, energy and blue collar approach… He establishes good early position and gets a high number of easy looks in transition thanks to his ability to run the floor … Battles for position and is able to get touches very close to the basket because he seals and counterseals extremely well … Has very good hands and makes difficult catches in traffic and on the move … Shows the ability to turn to both shoulders effectively and can finish with mini jump hooks with both hands … He is becoming more comfortable using his body and quick feet to beat defenders to the spot … He flashes the ability to faceup and attack off the bounce, but he will need to continue to polish his handles before he can fully utilize his quick and long first step … Finds the seams in the defence and gets to the openings for quick and easy finishes without having plays run for him … When his energy level is high he can be a very good rebounder, especially on the offensive end … He has an extremely quick second jump, and he is able to time his attack and get his hands on a high percentage of missed shots … His length also posses problems on the defensive end, as he is able to recover quickly or slide over from the weakside to block and contest shots around the basket … 

Weaknesses: At 6-9 he is a bit on the short side as a power forward at the next level … Although he has terrific length, and good athleticism, they do not negate his size issues completely … Also, at this point in his career he plays more as a center as his game is strictly confined to the low block … The major inadequacy that limits his game to the paint is the fact that his jumper needs serious work … He showed very little confidence in it all year and the ones he did take looked hesitant and were off-balance (he shoots with a major fade on almost every shot) … He shoots the ball over his head and extends the release too high, making his stroke very erratic and the results extremely inconsistent… To compound the issue, he shot an abysmal 49% from the foul line, raising the concern level on his outside touch even more … He needs to improve his back to the basket repertoire, adding counter moves once his initial drive gets cut off would benefit his game … Struggles against stronger defenders, can be bodied out of position and into off-balance shots … He is an inconsistent performer, his energy fluctuates drastically from game to game, and he doesn’t play with the same drive every night … Has disappeared in some big games this season … There is a strong correlation between his scoring and rebounding numbers, if he doesn’t get touches early in the game he will not look to get to the glass with the same aggressiveness on either end … Born in 1991, he is a full year older than his class …"
"NBA Comparison: Ben Gordon

Strengths: Instant offense type of shooter/scorer at the lead guard position …Very composed. Always on balance, never seems to rush things. Good pace to his game. Plays smart, values the basketball … Aggressive scorer with a crafty offensive game. Really knows how to create shots and has a strong one on one game. Good shot selection … Can knock opponents off balance and uses hesitation moves extremely well to create shots with opponents falling off balance and out of his way … Strong jump shooter and mid-range game with a strong ability to create shots for himself off the dribble … Beautiful shooting motion with excellent lift, a smooth, quick release and excellent overall form … Has the physique of an NBA linebacker with huge shoulders and a barrel chest and uses his excellent body strength to his advantage … Great strength allows him to absorb contact and finish around the rim … Strength also gives him deep range and the ability to shoot with the same accuracy late in games … Equally adept at spotting up or pulling up for shots off the dribble ... Huge wingspan allows him to finish at the rim and play bigger than 6’2 … Handles the ball extremely well. A strong defender that anticipates well and uses his strength to wear down and frustrate smaller guards … Strong on the break ... Has good speed when he gets a head of steam. Solid decision maker in transition …

Weaknesses: Solid athlete though nothing extraordinary. Lacks tremendous leaping ability … Lacks great blow by speed off the dribble … More of a scorer than a true point guard. Was not responsible for being the team’s primary point guard (Ronald Nored) … Vision and passing ability are below average for a point guard … Showing that he can be more of a full time lead guard and is capable of running the show would increase his value … Should look to increase his a/to ratio (1.46)… Playing at a mid-major, it’s tougher to prove his talent on a consistent basis … A year old for his class as he will turn 22 before the 2011 draft ... Could be on a long learning curve at the next level due to his inexperience playing the PG position, which could result in being traded a few times before finding his game (ala Chauncey Billups)

Notes: The answer to the puzzle of Butler's 2010 NCAA tourney success ... Showed that he’s capable of hanging with the NCAA elite helping Gordon Hayward and Butler reach the title game with an impressive performance in the NCAA tourney … Is sure to take on a much bigger role in the offense with Hayward no longer on the team … A player that scouts are high on.

"Strengths: Lithuanian bigman with great size and rebounding instincts ... Has a long 6'11"" frame and a huge wingspan to go along with it ... Very fluid athlete ... Runs the court well for a center ... Good quickness and solid explosiveness/leaping ability ... Strength/weight has been improving, and he should continue to add more in the future ... Uses all of his physical skills to the fullest when attacking the glass ... Extremely aggressive rebounder both offensively and defensively ... Gets a lot of tip-ins and put-backs ... Shows a good understanding of boxing out, which is somewhat rare for young players ... Uses great length to either grab or tip out-of-area rebounds to teammates ... Solid shot blocker with the potential to be very good in this area ... Competes hard on defense ... Length allows him to contest entry passes ... Super active on both ends of the court ... In the paint he shows a variety of developing moves ... Has a nice jump-shot from 8-12 feet away from the hoop ... Has great shooting mechanics and an extraordinarily soft touch for a bigman ... Has a developing hook shot that could be deadly in time ... Often used in pick and roll situations ... Favorite move is to ""slip"" after setting up for a pick, and cut to the rim ... Keeps the ball high and away from any secondary defenders ... Incredibly efficient (shot 70.8% from the field in the Euroleague) ... Doesn't miss a lot of shots because he operates so close to the rim ... If he doesn't have a high-percentage shot he immediately passes the ball out ... Remarkable free-throw shooter (88.5%) ... Tough player that's not afraid of contact ... Just turned 19 and has a great deal of potential ... Has a lot of enthusiasm for the game, and eager to improve. Unlike a lot of bigmen that were pushed into the game of basketball, it's obvious he has a genuine love for the game ... 

Weaknesses:  Can't create his own offense yet ... Has a budding set of skills in the post, but needs teammates who can set him up ... No real perimeter game ... Almost all offense comes from around the hoop ... Very unselfish but not a talented passer ... Makes a lot of mistakes when trying to pass out of double teams ... Plays very aggressively, which is a good quality, but it gets him in foul trouble quickly ... Needs to learn how to play good defense without fouling ... Hasn't developed the habit of remaining stationary when setting screens ... Struggles guarding stronger players ... Still skinny, though he is showing progress in this area ... Is currently signed with Lietuvos Rytas and the buyout option in his contract is over $3 million dollars, so he may not see the NBA for a few seasons ... Very wet behind the ears. 

Overall: European scouts are unanimously high on this kid, many feel that he desrves to be a top 5 pick ... Valanciunas' combination of size, skill and motor gives him a high amount of intrigue ... He isn't a finished product, so whatever team drafts him will have to be patient ... Has a buyout in the range of 3 million which could dissuade some teams from selecting him ... The lockout comes at a perfect time for him as he can continue to develop for another year overseas ...

Excellent athletic ability ... Explosive, quick leaper with excellent body control ... Fast runner that always hustles down the court on both offense and defense ... Moves very well laterally ... Uses his defensive instincts, long arms and quick feet to deny his man penetration ... Has the potential to defend up to three positions in the NBA ... Uses his physical abilities to make a lot of big plays defensively ... A fantastic shot blocker for a wing player ... Averaged 2.1 swats a game in his sophomore season ... Quick feet and anticipation should translate into a lot of steals as well ... Despite thin frame, is a monster rebounder for a wing player (7.2 RPG) ...

Perimeter shooting ability is showing signs of improvement ... Has become more comfortable shooting from behind the arc this season (55 3PTM, 36.2%) ... Very smart player with a high basketball IQ ...

Weaknesses: Very thin for any position ... 187 lbs on a 6'8"" frame could lead to a multitude of problems at the next level ... Did not have a lot of success defending the post in school and this weakness will certainly be taken advantage of in the NBA ... Poor finisher around the rim ... Lacks the strength to stay on balance after much contact ... Inconsistent scoring ability ... Has trouble creating his own shot off the dribble and slashing to the rim ... Didn't shoot well from the floor in his sophomore season (40.6 FG%) ... Wasn't an efficient passer either, averaging more turnovers (3.0) than assists (2.8) ... May lack the confidence to become a great scorer ...

Overall: Honeycutt comes from a UCLA program that has produced a lot of great NBA players that didn't overwhelm with their college production ... Adding weight will be very important in Honeycutt's transition to the next level ... Is a very talented player with an intriguing skill-set and he should find a place in the mid-late first round ...

Jan has good motor and excellent ability to run the floor (most of his points are off of dunks, put-backs and points in transition) ... Good hands around the basket ... Facing up to the basket, he is able to get to the rim quickly due to his quickness and good first step. Very explosive off the floor when attacking the bucket and finishes strong ... As a shooter he improved since last year and feels more confident taking shots outside the 3pt line and creating off the dribble; his mechanics and follow-through look fluid; good elevation on his shot ... If he catches the ball and his feet are set and pointed towards the basket he usually will knock down shots ... Defensively he is good, thanks to his length and can guard multiple positions ... His lateral quickness is impressive for his size and he does a solid job at moving his feet (good P&R defender and closes well on the perimeter staying in front of guards) ... Plays with lot of emotion ... A competitive player that hustles for loose balls and brings energy on the court ...

Weaknesses: Vesely needs to continue improving his offensive skills. He's still a work in progress as a player as his athleticism and ""wow plays"" exceed his effectiveness and consistency ... He has had a decent season but more was expected from him coming into the year ... He is limited to one or two dribbles when creating off the dribble and needs to improve his 1-on-1 game and ball-handling skills ... Has to become more efficient/consistent shooter overall (50% FG, 46% FT, 46.3% 3FG in Euroleague and 74.1 % FG, 51% FT, 31.8% 3FG in NLB League) ... Hasn't added any weight since last year and will have to get stronger in order to compete in the NBA; still has trouble finishing plays under pressure ... Has strength and athleticism but not productive enough as a rebounder (4.4 rpg in NLB League and only 2.9 rpg in Euroleague) ... Could run into some problems fitting into an NBA position as his length slows him some on the perimeter in the half court set and he lacks the strength and toughness to play in the paint right now ...

"NBA Comparison: Carlos Boozer/Sean May

Strengths: Broad shoulders and burly body have the potential to be chiseled into a vintage power forward ... Has dramatically improved his conditioning since he arrived on campus, but work remains to be done ... Works hard on the court as well as off it, hustling down court on fast breaks more often than many others his size. ... Impossible to stop when he's moving forward in the paint because of his size. ... Very soft touch combined with a willingness to go with a layup instead of a risky dunk ... Developing instincts as far as passing out of double teams ... Perhaps the most improved player in the country between his freshman and sophomore seasons, and the room to grow is still obvious ... Hounds the boards and boxes out well. Also has great hands and doesn't lose many balls he gets to ... Playing in a flex offense system that thrives on the fast break has allowed him experience at playing all sorts of roles on the court, from high post to wing to his most natural low post spot. ... Agility well above average allows him to control his balance and footwork in post ... Shows a high motor and desire to compete and improve ...

Weaknesses: Still a bit out of shape and lumbers at times because he's always running up and down the court. Plays hard but not always smart ... Still needs to improve at feeling a double team rather than turning into it before realizing he needs to pass ... Lacks ideal length and often seems to be at his worse when longer, taller players smother him in the post. ... Still developing his post moves, though they've come a long way since his freshman season. ... Jump shot is generally off, despite seamless mechanics and a feathery touch around the basket. Looks like a natural shooter from 15 feet, but the shots just don't go in. Particularly from the line - 50% ... May not be a true 6-foot-10.

"Strengths: A very explosive 6’9” center with a terrific wingspan ... He’s able to run the floor with very good speed and hustles at all times ... As he gains experience, his skills will certainly permit him to become a very solid defensive player, possibly a shot blocking specialist ... Quickness and footspeed are surely good enough to defend inside players, hedge and recuperate on the pick and roll ... Toughness and intensity are fine, balance is okay too, although as he gets stronger and adds volume it’ll be easier for him to hold inside positions and become a better finisher in the paint. Biyombo is a player who likes to play above the rim. Additionally he has nice skills in the low post to attack the basket, using fakes, spin moves and jump hooks ... A quick first step and ability to put the ball on the floor allow him also to make one dribble power moves to the basket .. Appears to be a quick study, developing his skill level to the point where it is ... There have been numerous African players who have been brought to European leagues and failed to accomplish what Biyombo has (impacting a high level ACB team) ... As for rebounding, Bismack usually tries to box out and goes for offensive boards quite fiercely ... In just a few months playing with the first team of Fuenlabrada in the ACB, defensive positioning in help side has improved a lot to become a consistent intimidating force in the paint ... considered a high character kid by all accounts ... Hands aren't bad considering how raw he is and that many African players have below average hand eye coordination, and he could even develop into a pick and roll option. "
"Strengths: An offensively gifted power forward with ideal size for his position ... Stands about 6'10"" in shoes with a long wingspan ... Has good overall strength, which he uses often in post-up situations ... Has a very versatile low-post game ... Exceptional footwork with fast and efficient pivot moves ... Looks great on either side of the hoop and can finish after turning over either shoulder ... Has a developing hook shot that shows a lot of promise ... Soft hands and a knack for establishing position makes him an easy target for post-entry passes ... Uses a lot of fakes under the rim ... Makes the defense commit and then takes advantage ... Doesn't waste any time making his move after catching the ball ... Keeps the ball high and away from roaming defenders ... Tough to knock off balance ... Has a nice 10-15 foot turnaround jump shot ... Can also score facing up ... Displays a good form on his jumper, displaying a very high release ... Great catch and shoot player from either shoulder or the baseline ... Looks comfortable shooting out to the college three point line ... Good ball-handler, but prefers only one or two dribbles to get his spot on the block or pull up for a perimeter jumper ... Unselfish player that can find open teammates when double-teamed... Despite not being much of an athlete, is a good finisher in transition ... Showing a lot of improvement on the defensive side of the court ... Contests shots well and doesn't give up when his opponent gets a step on him ...

Weaknesses: Not a great athlete ... Leaping ability is below average ... Has quick feet around the rim, but won't win many foot-races in the NBA ... Poor lateral movement limits his defensive potential ... Solid shot blocker, but won't be very intimidating at the next level ... Conditioning has been an issue for him throughout his college career (measured a 15.5% body fat at the 2011 NBA Draft Combine) ... Stands to gain a lot in terms of athleticism by improving conditioning, which begs the question: why hasn't he improved it already? ... Toughness has been questioned ... A bit turnover prone when trying to make ambitious passes ... Questionable motor that can probably be attributed to his conditioning ...

Overall: Thompkins has the potential to be a good scoring threat in the NBA ... He has a great inside/outside game that a lot of teams could find appealing in a bench scorer, but 82 games is a long season and Thompkins could have problems getting and staying in shape ... Even with his flaws he's got the talent to contribute, and a team in the late 1st to early 2nd round will be willing to pick him up...

Tyler Ingle 6/12/11"
"Strengths: Big, versatile forward with a very high basketball IQ ... Stands 6'9.75"" in shoes, which is an ideal height for a small forward at the next level ... Fluid runner ... Doesn't jump out of his shoes, but gets around the court well ... Very active off the ball ... Is relentless running up and down the baseline ... Finds ways to lose his defender ... Uses screens well ... Has a very pure shooting stroke ... Great shooting mechanics with a smooth release ... Shoots with confidence out to 25-26 feet away from the basket ... Scrambles the defense with a lot of shot/pass fakes ... Solid ball-handler that will sometimes play a “point-forward” role for his team … A creative and unselfish passer ... Always seems to know where his teammates are and displays excellent timing when getting them the ball ... Great rebounder (7.8 RPG in 2010-2011) … Outstanding instincts in pressure situations ... One of the most clutch players in the draft ... Well-known for making a 75-foot game-winning three point shot at the buzzer in overtime against North Carolina State on January 3rd, 2010 ...

Weaknesses: Not very aggressive as a scorer ... Has a lot of offensive ability but only seems willing/comfortable playing within an offense and taking what the defense gives him ... Probably more unselfish than a player with his ability should be ... Nothing more than an average athlete and lacks a great amount of explosiveness around the rim ... Only an average defender ... Prone to getting beat off the dribble ... Will struggle guarding athletic small forwards at the next level, but lacks the strength to guard power forwards ... Is a surprisingly poor free-throw shooter … Shot only 55.7% from the stripe in his senior season …

Overall: Parsons is a fantastic team player ... He doesn't have to dominate the ball to be effective and he is very a willing passer ... He's not going to be a defensive stopper or a go-to scorer, but he could be a very serviceable player off the bench for a good team ... Look for him to be taken in the early second round ..."
"Strengths: Walker's game is marked by ""electricity"" and explosiveness. Plays with an undefinable burst, seemingly moving in warp speed while everyone else is standing still- yet he remains for the most part under control, with the ball on a string. Working in his favor is a freakish blend of raw speed, breathtaking quickness, ultra-aggression and sneaky power. Scores from anywhere on the court (23.5 ppg). Can't be contained by a single defender off the dribble, be it in the half court or most notably in transition. Splits double teams and traps in a blink. Changes direction at FULL speed. He is a master at creating space, using jab steps, cross overs and pump fakes to shed defenders. Highly creative with the rock in his hands and finishing at the rim. Able to complete plays through contact with a full head of steam. Also able to re-adjust angles and avoid shot blockers by hanging and improvising in mid-air. Constantly in attack mode, frequently living at the charity stripe (7.7 attempts). Scoop shots and floaters are not foreign to his arsenal either. Overall shooting aptitude has improved dramatically since arriving on campus. His range shooting is now a real weapon (33% on 5.5 attempts), despite a myriad of low percentage, bail out chucks. He's always been extremely comfortable shooting step back J's off the dribble, but displayed a new wrinkle coming off screens as the season progressed. Solid elevation and high release. Tremendous two-footed leaper in space. Despite his gift for the putting the ball in the bucket, he's very much a facilitator (4.5 apg), creating open shots for others by commanding a second/third defender. Prolific rebounder for his size (5.4 rpg), completely unafraid to mix it up with bigger bodies. Excellent lateral quickness with fluid hips. Beats the offensive player to the spot. Opportunistic defensively- if you're careless with the ball, he'll take it back the other way for a deuce (1.9 stl). His motor never runs low (38 minutes per). A true winner with a warrior's spirit. 

Weaknesses: His measurement of 6'1 with shoes was a win, but he remains an undersized commodity, his standing reach of 7'7.5 is the same as 5'10 PG Isaiah Thomas. Defending the new breed of NBA point guards will be a severe challenge. He takes a ton of hits in his 184-pound frame, and while he's been anything but fragile, it's a concern over the long haul. Walker's an unselfish distributor and a dynamic playmaker, but he'll never be mistaken for an orchestrator or true lead guard. Connecticut's half court offense was largely late clock isolations: can he get a team organized and operate an NBA style, functional system? Has a tendency to play out of control times, but to his credit he has learned to pace himself when the situation calls for it (2.3 turnovers). It's difficult to cage a lion, and as a result he will go through patches where he gets caught up in the emotion of the game. Too many out of control shot attempts, attacking the trees wildly when there's simply nothing available. Fearless is a great quality as long as it doesn't reach the point of reckless. Criticizing him for lack of efficiency (43% fg) is probably unfair given the tremendous burden placed upon his shoulders. Nevertheless, he does have a tendency to waste possessions. He finished in traffic at the collegiate level, but the NBA paint is a different animal. Continued advancement in the mid-range, pull up game will go a long ways in getting more quality looks and saving his body. Shooting stroke needs fine tuning, particularly from range. Arc on his jumper brings rain and inhibits consistent results.

Adam Ganeles 5/24/11"
"Strengths: A highly touted prep big man, Tyler was considered at or ner the top of his class for a very long time …When you look at him it’s obvious why, as he looks like an NBA big man despite his age, at 6’10 260 … Moves well and shows good coordination and fluidity for a guy his size … Possesses a monster 7’5 wingspan and big hands, so he’ll be able to play larger than his height … Shows a potentially solid post game with a raw, albeit, interesting amount of moves and counters, that he definitely flashes with the ball at times … Shows good footwork for his size … Has the raw ability to score some with both hands already … Possesses a feathery soft touch, and it allows him to face-up with consistent range out to 18 feet … Generally looks to finish emphatically when in point blank range … Can operate in the high or low post … Provides pretty good rebounding ability and has the size for that to translate ... 

Weaknesses: Although he’s got good size and athleticism, he’s not all that decisive in his moves and he will be easier for NBA posts to defend until he tightens his moves with the ball in his hands … Although he has the groundwork and foundation of his post game, he’s not polished with it yet … Settles for the jumper often…Relies on his size too much, and it leads to inconsistent efficiency offensively and makes him a very shaky defender … Doesn’t play very hard, and it’s not rare for him not to run back on defense and his team to give up a basket or an offensive rebound ... Needs to develop focus, consistentcy and discipline ... Struggled mightily with fouls when he was playing in Japan this past season, and wasn’t much better in Israel either ... Displays a low basketball IQ and raw decision-making skills, and he’s pretty turnover prone … Doesn’t really like to pass the ball…There are legit questions about his maturity and character … Quit the team when he was playing in Israel, didn’t adjust to the style of play, had trouble earning playing time over other talented players on the teams roster, and complained about playing time … Struggles with the thought that other players are also as talented as he is. Has been somewhat dilusional about his own ability but seems to have received a wake up call of sorts … Him going to Japan was better, but he still showed inefficiency and struggled with his decision-making in limited playing time there against even weaker competition than he faced in Israel … A bit of a project, and won’t be ready to effectively compete on an NBA floor in the near future ... Lockout on the horizon doesn't help his cause being a ""project"" without immediate help from a team ... 

Overall: Tyler has the physical tools and upside offensively for a team to take him in the late 1st or preferably early 2nd, where there is less risk involved … His shaky production overseas and the headaches he’s caused are huge reasons for concern though … Tyler’s upside is great, but he’s a work in progress and a project as a player … He’s going to need to be on his best behavior in the NBA too, as he’s not good enough to be a disruption ..."
"NBA Comparison: Mark Price/Eddie House

Strengths: An absolutely relentless scorer ... Led nation in points per game with 28.9 ... Wide array of ways to put the ball in the basket ... Great size and strength for a point guard ... Strong finisher around the rim ... Uncanny shooting ability ... Volume shooter that maintains efficiency; averaged 3.3 three-pointers made per game in his senior season on 39.6% ... Gets an outstanding amount of elevation on his jump shot ... Won't dazzle with high-flying dunks, but uses the athleticism he has very well ... Tough to stop in transition ... Can pull-up for a quick jump shot from anywhere on the court ... Unlimited range ... Supreme confidence in his shooting ability, won't hesitate to fire from as far as 30 feet away from the basket ... Able to make shots even when appearing well off-balance ... Great free-throw shooter (89.4%) ... Underrated quickness ... Nasty ball-handling ability ... Deadly crossover ... Frequently throws off defenders with well-timed hesitations moves off the dribble ... Can create a lot of space for himself, with or without the ball ... Doesn't have to dominate the ball to be effective ... Crafty mid-range game ... Comes off screens extremely well ... Automatic catch-and-shoot ability ... Talented passer that has the ability to create open shots for his teammates ... Thrives in high-pressure situations ... Very unselfish ... Very high basketball IQ ... Tough, physical player that doesn't shy away from contact ... Gym rat, always focused on improving his game ... Smart, well-spoken kid that always seems to impress in his interviews ...

Weaknesses: A very poor defender at BYU ... His team couldn't afford for him to get in foul trouble which may account for his lackluster defensive effort ... Struggles to close out on shooters ... As the primary offensive option on his team, he hasn't proven he can be a pass-first point guard ... Assist-to-turnover ratio is poor (4.3 assists to 3.5 turnovers), but understandable due to his role on the team ... Prone to getting blocked on his drives to the rim ... Athleticism is certainly below average for an NBA point guard, which may hinder his ability to get his shot off at the next level …

Overall: Gained a huge following his senior year in college as he won National Player of the Year ... Will be an instant impact player in the NBA as a scorer/shooter off the bench and if he can tighten up his defense and find a system that works for him, he has the potential to be a very good starting point guard ... Will be a likely lottery pick ...

"Strengths: Leuer is coming off a solid season in which he averaged 15 points in his 3rd season at Wisconsin ... At 6'10, Leuer presents matchup problems with his combination of size, outside stroke, and the ability to put the ball on the floor ... He possesses excellent footwork in the post, using an array of post moves that make him unpredictable with his back to the basket ... He shows nice touch in the post, and looks comfortable turning and shooting in any direction ... He has range up to 21 feet out, shooting 39% from downtown at the college level ... His handle is better than average for a college forward/center, and he uses it to create open looks for himself in the post and on the perimeter ... Has shown he's aware of what's available around him in terms of passing out of the post ... Offensively he's very efficient, shooting 52% from the floor while only turning it over once a game ...

Has perfect form on his shot and deep range. Squares to the basket. Quick, concise, fluid stroke with a high release ... Gets his shot off quickly and can do so without needing much space ... Exhibits prudent shot selection ... Large wingspan allows him to play more athletic than he appears. Can dunk on his defenders if he catches opponents napping ... Solid decision maker with a positive a/to ratio ... 1.6 steals per game as a senior showed his progression as a defender / anticipation ... Extremely level headed, doesn't show a great deal of emotion or get rattled easily ... 

Weaknesses: An average athlete who plays below the rim ... He's a ""momentum athlete"" in the sense that he shows solid athleticism when he has momentum moving towards the rim ... Much better in the half court than in the open floor. His lack of elite athleticism gets exposed in the transition game ... Lacks great foot speed which inhibits his ability to take the ball off the dribble against quick defenders ... Recevied a one game suspension due to a marijuana possession charge, but scouts don't seem too concerned about that therefore it hasn't affected his stock much ... Long, athletic defenders can give him trouble ... 

Notes: Was among the top 10 scorers in the nation as a junior at 22.1 ppg ... He's the son of former #1 overall pick Mychal Thompson (1978) ... Put up 43 points at Washington knocking down eight 3 point shots ... 

Aran Smith 4/22/11"
"Strengths: Confident lead guard with a good amount of mismatch potential ... Excellent size for a point guard, standing 6'5.25"" tall with a 6'7.5"" wingspan ... Strong finishing ability due to size and body control ... Powerful first step, which is surprising considering his lack of great foot speed ... Very aggressive ... Can drive well with either hand ... Uses hesitations, spin moves and crossovers to break down his defender in isolation situations ... Has the potential to use his size in the post against smaller point guards ... Very gifted passer in a half-court offense ... Tremendous court vision ... Led the Big Ten in assists per game his sophomore year, averaging 6.7 on the season ... Operates well in pick-and-roll situations, keeping his head up and displaying excellent timing on passes ... Good frame with the potential to hold a little more muscle ... Good teammate and a vocal leader on the floor … A true point guard with a good feel for the position and at just 20 years of age has solid potential ... 

Weaknesses: Doesn't possess any outstanding athletic qualities ... Not an explosive leaper ... Lacks great speed or quickness ... Lacks a great understanding of how to control transition opportunities, often attempting to force the issue despite being outnumbered ... Underdeveloped catch-and-shoot ability hurts his potential to play well without dominating the ball... Prone to taking ill-advised shots ... Shot only 25% from behind the arc last season ... Only an average defender due to lack of lateral speed ... Struggles to recover after being screened … His age is both a positive and a negative. At 20, he's got upside, but will likely take some time to be NBA ready, and learning the NBA position on the fly is a challenge ... 

Overall: One of the best passers in the draft and he's only a sophomore, so he still has a lot of room to improve ... A reliable outside jumper would really round out his offensive game … A sleeper. Has starting point guard potential, and should be a 1st round pick in this year’s draft …

"NBA Comparison: Eddie Jones/Evan Turner

Strengths: Burks has NBA shooting guard size at 6'6 with an excellent 6'10 wingspan, and even shows some point guard abilities ... An advanced ball-handler who can get to the rim in traffic using either hand... Uses his athleticism and feel for the rim to finish in the paint... Has excellent scoring instincts and really knows how to create his own shot ... Possesses a rhythmic bounce to his step that allows him to pullup off the hesitation dribble ... 82% free throw shooting on 7.9 free throw attempts per game ... Excels in the open court, where he uses long strides and his athletic ability to convert on fast break opportunities ... His versatility allows him to play both as a slasher off the ball, or a combo guard with the ball ... Shows good court vision and a willingness to create for others, illustrated by his 2.9 assists per game ... Anticipates well on the glass, bringing in 6.5 rebounds in just 31 minutes per game ... He's long and athletic enough to be an effective defender at the next level ...

Weaknesses: From a physical standpoint, Burks needs to add bulk and muscle to his 192 pound body ... Lacking strength and explosveness, he could struggle finishing at the rim in the pro's, as opposed to college where he relied heavily on his athleticism ... He shot poorly from downtown at just 29%, and really needs to become more of a consistent threat from the outside. Mechanics on his shot break down when he shoots from outside 15 feet. Sort of pushes the ball instead of shooting it in one fluid motion. Actually shows better mechanics when shooting moving towards the basket than when on balance and going straight up ... Midrange game also lacked consistency, shooting too many off-balance jumpers off the dribble ... Will need to adjust playing primarily off the ball with less opportunities to dominate the ball... Vulnerable defensively in one on one situations against smaller, quicker guards

Overall: Burks has excellent upside and the potential to become a fixture in someone's rotation ... If he can start knocking down his jumpers on a more consistent basis, he can become a real offensive threat considering his ability to create his own shot and get to the line ...

Gets squared up to the basket in a flash ... Outstanding catch and shoot ability will make him dangerous coming off of screens ... Great shooting range, will have very little trouble adjusting to the NBA three-point line ... Not exceptionally quick, but shows good mobility running the floor ... Good enough ball-handler to create his own shot, but prefers just one or two quick dribbles before firing away ... Strong court-vision and impressive passing ability ... Very active player that always plays hard on both ends of the floor ... Standing 6'10"" will present him an advantage playing on the perimeter in the NBA ... Solid character guy who works hard to improve ..."
"Strengths: Markieff Morris has improved his value as an NBA prospect with each year while playing at Kansas ... Morris is a strong, muscular 6'10 with an NBA body at 21 years old ... He does an excellent job at finishing around the rim, using long and effective drop steps for better positioning when dealing in the paint ... Shows nice touch on his short, over the shoulder baby hook shot ... He's become extremely efficient from the perimeter, shooting 42% from downtown and looking fluent and comfortable in spot up opportunities ... Averaged a block and 8.3 rebounds in just 24 minutes of play, illustrating his high activity level and aggressive nature on the interior ... Defensively he plays with focus and passion, using his strength to force tough shots in the post ... Both he and his twin Marcus exhibit an aggressive ""bullying"" demeanor ...

Weaknesses: He's effective within a few feet of the rim and as a spot up shooter on the perimeter, but he's missing an in between game ... Facing up and using a dribble is not part of his repertoire ... Missing advanced high post moves, and struggles to draw fouls despite his physical interior play ... His ceiling is not as high as some of the other longer more athletic bigs ... 

Overall: Morris set of skills will certainly be coveted by NBA teams looking for stability and depth up front ... He shows pick n' pop potential and the ability to man up opposing bigs... Though he lacks the upside of most lottery picks, he's one of the safest options in this year's draft ... Comparing him to his brother Marcus, Markieff is bigger, stronger and more athletic but lacks his younger twin's offensive ability..."
"Strengths: A combo guard with good quickness and length … Getting out in transition is his strong suit, as he has a long stride and can change direction without losing speed … A decent athlete, he has the ability to finish with an improving mix of moves around the basket … Using his length he can extend to the rim and complete plays with both hands … He is showing a better understanding of how to shield the ball and absorb contact by using his body on drives … His quick first step and long strides make him a dangerous slasher, and he has the ability to turn the corner and find the gaps in the defence when getting to the hoop … He handles the ball well and can make moves in the open court that allow him to create space and separation … Shows a nice repertoire of moves of the dribble as well, and he knows how to get his defender off balance in order to get separation … Moves fairly well without the ball, reading the spacing on the weakside and cutting to the basket with well timed cuts …Has continued to work on his shot, and improvements are evident in his percentages … He has a nice defensive package and his understanding of positioning allows him to make plays within the team concept ... His length and lateral quickness are also tools which will allow him to defend both guard positions at the next level …

Weakness: His position will be a question mark in the NBA… Not a great decision maker, he does not play with the poise nor does he have the mentality of a playmaker … He does not make good decisions in traffic, he has a tendency of leaving his feet to make passes and does not usually deliver the ball on target … Has almost a 1/1 assist to turnover ratio for his career, further showing that he is a liability as a primary ballhandler … As an off-guard, he lacks the frame and mass to be able to battle with the bigger and stronger opponents … His biggest deficiency is the continued inconsistency with his jumpshot, which allows defenders to play off of him and take away his penetration … Even with the improvements, he still shoots a different jumper almost every attempt and his elbow tends to go too far to the outside … The release point also varies and he has a bad habit of hanging too long in the air and shooting on the way down (especially off the dribble) … 

Notes: A number of guards who struggled to thrive in Ben Howland’s system at UCLA have gone on to flourish in the NBA, and this fact will certainly help Lee’s case. However, he does not posses the physical package or the skill set that his predecessors did and a complete comparison is certainly unjustified.

Very skilled in spot up shooting situations... Can drive to the basket well with either hand ... Crafty ball-control combined with overwhelming strength makes him hard to keep out of the lane... Finds unique ways to finish at the rim ... Very aggressive in transition, never shying away from contact ... Due to physicality, spends a lot of time at the free throw line (6.7 FTA per game) ... Impressive assist/turnover ratio (2.16 assists per turnover) and good overall playmaking ability suggest he can play the point guard position at the next level... Very unselfish... Makes an effort defensively... With his long arms and good anticipation, he forces a good amount of steals (1.7 SPG)... Clutch performer... Smart kid who plays very hard..."
"Strengths: A hybrid forward with terrific length … He has a high motor and plays the game with a lot of energy … Spends majority of the time on the perimeter, but occasionally shows the ability to play with his back to the basket … Uses an effective turnaround jumper inside when posting up … An agile athlete, his strides are extremely long and he covers a lot of space when running the floor … Shows improvement in majority of areas from freshman to sophomore seasons … His shooting has improved and he has become a respectable threat from the outside … Operating out of the triple threat, he combines a nice jab with a fairly quick and long first step to create separation … He has a strong preference going to his pull-up jumper, and once he gets into a rhythm he can string a number makes together (his length and high release make it a difficult shot to contest) … He is fairly comfortable handling the ball in the open court and is capable of pushing it out off the rebound when the situation calls for it … Even with the improvements to his offensive game, he still continues to contribute heavily in the rebounding department … His huge hangs, length, energy and great timing, allow him to snatch balls on both ends that are well outside of his rebounding area … An extremely quick jumper, he is very good at tipping the ball and keeping it alive on the rim … Has the instincts and shows potential in becoming a very solid defender … His ability to get out in the passing lanes and also contest shots inside make him a very dangerous weapon on the defensive end …"
"Strengths: Possesses absolutely great size for a C prospect at 7’ 260, and a 7’4 wingspan… Vucevic is a very skilled offensive player, who can be a pretty good C in the NBA … In the post, his size and length make him a viable target for post entry passes … Will call for the ball and works to establish position with his sturdy base … Shows the ability to pull off a good amount of moves (namely a right-handed turnaround jumper, a drop step, and jump hooks with both hands) and can finish with both hands around the rim…Makes some use of counter moves and fakes…Has the added ability to step out and make jump shots from as far 26 ft., although he’s most comfortable from the 18 ft. area…Will be a factor in the pick and pop game … Very soft touch…Above average free throw shooter for a C at 75% this past season … Able to function from the low or high post, and is a solid decision maker in both spots, showing the knowledge of when to shoot and when to kick out to cutters and shooters … Soft hands and rarely ever bobbles or drops psses ... Rebounds very well on both ends of the floor, and shows solid fundamentals when boxing out and corralling the ball

Weaknesses: The main kink in Vucevic’s armor definitely revolves his lack of athleticism … Doesn’t run the floor very well and lacks any real explosiveness … Not very quick in his movements, and sometimes struggles with getting his shot off down low against the more athletic and long posts he faces at times … Definitely plays below the rim … Not going to be a great factor on D or as a shot-blocker at the next level…A step slow in pick and roll D, and will show up late on hedges…Has to be accounted for on D, using team defensive principles to not be a liability on this end … Playing with USC and two former NBA coaches give him experience in NBA-style defensive schemes, which will help, but he’s not gonna stop anyone on this end … Has ball-handling skills for his size, but not enough foot speed to really take much advantage

Overall: Nikola Vucevic is considered the top NCAA C prospectin this draft. He possesses very good size and offensive skills and isn’t a bad decision maker. His low post game is nice as is his face-up game, and he rebounds well for good measure. His lack of athleticism is a concern, and it limits him, but mostly on defense. And what is the real problem with a big 7’ 260 guy whose athleticism matches his size? I think he’ll be a good pick-up in the 1st round for a team.

Explosive leaping ability, recorded a 42"" vertical leap at the 2011 NBA Draft Combine ... Very fast in the open-court, able to pull down a rebound and go coast-to-coast in a matter of seconds ... Very strong for a point guard ... Uses his strength well on both offense and defense ... Scary in transition ... Excellent slasher ... Defenders practically bounce off him when he drives in the paint ... Able to finish in spectacular fashion at the rim, displaying fantastic hang-time and body-control ... A capable, though unsteady, playmaker ... Has good drive-and-dish potential at the next level ... A tenacious defensive player that works very hard to shut his man down... With his length and athleticism he could guard any of the 1-3 positions in the NBA ... Has ""lock-down defender"" potential ... Forces a ton of turnovers (2.7 SPG) ... A very good rebounder at the guard position, averaging 5.9 a game his junior year... Solid free-throw shooter (80.6%) that gets to the line a lot (5.64 FTA per game) due to his aggressiveness ... A stat-sheet stuffer, had a 22 point, 12 rebound, 11 assist, 7 steal performance against Virginia Tech on January 15th, 2011 …"
"Strengths: Amongst the top physical specimens in the '11 draft class, with rare athleticism, length and strength at 6'4 ... Thrives in open space utilizing his end-to- end speed and explosive leaping ability ... Powerful, compact frame. More than capable of withstanding a blow and finishing when contacted ... Not a comfortable sight for defenders while charging at the hoop: he'll either dunk over you or take you with him through the rim ... Body control, in-air adjustments and hang time are sublime ... A high percentage of his points (14.4) come as a result of the transition game and crashing the offensive glass (3.2 off) ... His mid-range shooting stroke is much improved, especially when afforded a couple of habit dribbles to get his legs underneath the shot ... Realistic range out to 15-18 feet ... Shot selection is a mainstay, recognizing his strengths and playing within them ... Shoots an efficient 49% from the floor and 80% from the foul line ... Playmaking is not a staple, but he's capable of getting inside the lane with a lightning quick first step ... Assist figures are on the rise (0.6 to 2.5 to 2.9). Versatile defender. Able to guard multiple positions using his combination of strength and agility ... An attacking presence defensively, trusting his physical gifts ... Quick hands and plays passing lanes well (1.1 career stl) ... Blocked a shot per game as a sophomore. 

Weaknesses: Doesn't fit the traditional shooting guard mold ... In a league infatuated with the three-point shot, Leslie has no extended range (0.4 3pt makes) ... Despite a spike in attempts (1.3), he'll never be a natural distance shooter ... Catch and shoot is not in his vocabulary ... Squares his body well, but needs time to eye the target ... When opponents lay off him on the perimeter you can feel the doubts creep into his mind ... Needs to be more free flowing and aggressive ... He starts thinking rather than reacting, usually leaving the burden to a teammate ... No defined offensive game at this stage in the half court set ... While ball handling has improved somewhat, it still inhibits his effectiveness in the face up game ... His off the dribble repertoire is elementary and lacks any real imagination ... For a two-guard, that's a difficult shortcoming to hide ... Less panache and attempts at the extraordinary, more attacking and getting to the FT line (4.1 attempts) ... His freakish athleticism will shine through regardless ... Seems satisfied to be a complimentary part. 

Notes: Has signed with an agent so he has committed to remain in the 2011 draft.

Adam Ganeles 4/15/11"
"Strengths: A small forward with terrific size and length for the position … He is an explosive leaper and has next level athleticism … A very good player in transition, he runs the floor extremely hard and is able to finish plays above the rim in open lane situations … His upper body is well built, and he has the strength to move defenders on drives to the basket … Has developed into a formidable catch and shoot threat … With his feet set he can shoot the ball with range and fairly consistently knock down jumpers from deep … Shows the ability to make shots from the NBA three point line … His biggest impact is on the defensive end, where his size, length, athleticism and terrific instincts make him a lockdown defender … He possesses all the tools to be able to translate his defense to the NBA level … Can guard multiple positions … His ability to anticipate and jump into passing lanes combined with shotblocking, make him a very rare threat on the defensive side of the ball … He is a blue-collar player and is capable of impacting the game without needing the ball in his hands or getting plays called for him … A solid rebounder, he is especially good on the O glass, where he uses his length and athleticism to get to rebounds … 

Weaknesses: Not a natural wing player, he is not very smooth with the ball and does not have the ballhandling skills which would allow him to create his shot with consistency … Not a great scorer, lacks the feel and touch around the basket and depends too much on his physical prowess to get him thorough situations… Has the size and length to score with his back to the basket, but his poor footwork and bodycontrol make it hard for him to get good shots off inside … Still a very streaky shooter, especially on the move or off the dribble … He tends to shoot without squaring his body, his stroke is not the most natural, and his release comes too far off his head … His legs are fairly skinny but he is top heavy, which makes his movements awkward but it also gives him poor balance … Improved on his free throw percentage, but it’s still not where it needs to be … 

Note: Singleton fractured his foot on Feb. 12 and had surgery shortly after. It will be interesting to see when he is able to return and if he will be effective enough to keep his stock high enough to remain in the 2011 draft.

Borko Popic 2/17/11"
"Strengths: Benson is a late blooming prospect who developed into one of the more productive big men in the college game in his last 3 years…Has good height at 6’11 for a PF/C, and a frame that is capable of adding as much as 15-20 lbs without the loss of mobility…Huge 7’4 wingspan…Runs the floor well and shows good reactive leaping skills that help him some on the glass and blocking shots…Displays a developing post game that is pretty solid right now…Has a very soft touch and is still adding moves to his repertoire…Has a right-handed jump hook that is very effective, and with his length looks to translate seamlessly…Never seems to rush into his moves…Has potential as a pick-and-pop threat with his developing touch…Is a pretty good shot-blocker with his length and quick leaping skills, who averaged more than 3 a contest at Oakland U…Not a bad rebounder…Willing to work on his game"
"Strengths: Tobias is a talented, combo forward with a skill-set suited for NBA play ... Has good versatility and a great feel for the game ... His ability to handle the ball makes him a tough match-up for opposing bigs, however he'll need to develop a consistent outside stroke to make him more of a threat off the dribble ... He uses a combination of strength and agility to either overpower or elude his defender ... He has broad shoulders solid upperbody with plenty of room to fill out ... Harris has the ability to put the ball on the floor, with a deceivingly quick first step that creates mismatch problems at the high post ... Shows timely slashing across the middle, where he can catch and score in the paint with either hand ... He has an excellent touch and feel around the basket, finding ways to convert on floaters and runners in the lane... Positions his body effectively for easy opportunities in the low post ... Solid leaper ... His long arms and upper-body strength should help him on the defensive side of the ball moving forward ... Has a lot of potential being one of the youngest players in the entire draft. Unlike many freshmen, he's an 18 year old ... A bright kid. A gymrat who works hard on his game and shows a mature ""professional"" mindset ... 

Weaknesses: At 6'8, he's slightly undersized at the power forward position, and lacks the athleticism, explosiveness and foot speed to guard most NBA small forwards ... He also lacks a refined post game, missing a go-to back to the basket move - relies too much on his pure feel for the basket ... Inconsistent spot up shooter without threatening range. Shows good form but did not shoot with very good numbers ... Pull-up or step-back jumper not currently in his repertoire ... Lack of great footspeed inhibits his ability to attack the rim off the dribble despite having quality ball handling ability ... Body appears a little pudgy. He needs to shed the babyfat and tone his body some ... 

Overall: Harris averaged 15 points and 7 rebounds in his freshman year on a disfunctional Tennessee team, proving to be one of the more versatile players in the country at just 18 years old ... His consistency and high basketball IQ at such a young age is an attractive quality to General Managers, and he managed to score in double figures in all but three games as a freshman ...

"Strengths: Legit seven footer … Lefty with excellent offensive potential ... Loves to face the basket from the perimeter. Can score from inside and outside … Has added weight to his frame in the past year, making him more effective in the low post … Good ball handling ability for a big man … Quick first step allows him to get by opponents ... Very confident player … Good at timing his jumps to contest shots … Runs the floor well, especially for a seven-footer … Can be a mismatch nightmare for opposing teams … One of the most skilled players in the draft … Very solid athletically … Can shoot the three … Capable of creating his own offense … Polished footwork … Skilled at passing out of the post … Can eat defenses up with the pick and roll/ pick and pop … Can use both hands well ...

Weaknesses: Being a 20 year old European and lacking strength means he will need time to adjust to the NBA game … Has some prima donna to him. He's talented and he knows it and often gets criticized for not being tough or showing enough passion for the game ... Poor rebounder for a big man. At times it appears he's averse to doing the ""dirty work"" … Defense could use a lot of work, at times looks uninterested in defending … Can be punished in the post … Streaky shooter … Needs to gain maturity, discipline, focus ... Lacks the strength of other post players … Poor anticipation skills leads to defensive lapses and missed rebounding opportunities … Not a very good free throw shooter, which is surprising considering his touch ...

"Strengths: Smith was a major contributor on a Duke team coming off a National Championship ... At 6'3, he has nice size and length for a point guard, and has enough overall awareness and skill to play off the ball as well ... With the ball in his hands, Smith's high basketball IQ and excellent ball security allow him to efficiently run an offense ... He shows nice touch in the lane when attacking the rim, with a good feel for when to float it/take it strong and when to dish it out to the open man ... He's a capable outside shooter, but generally shoots his best when someone creates open opportunities for him ... Smith's awareness allows him to read defenses and make the right pass in a timely fashion, and despite not being a pure point guard, he's trusted at the position with his excellent decision making and offensive efficiency ... Defensively his best attributes revolve around his length, IQ and effort ...

Weaknesses: Smith's biggest obstacle at the next level will be trying to create separation between him and his defender ... He lacks explosiveness, and therefore takes longer to execute his move and get by his defender... He's not a dynamic athlete, which limits his upside considering he already struggles in the one on one game... Though he shot a very respectable 39% from downtown last season, he will need to continue improving his outside game in order to make him more of a threat offensively ... Defensively he might have trouble guarding NBA 2 guards, limiting his services ...

Overall: Though he won't turn heads with any one aspect of his game, Smith has proven to be reliable in terms sharing the playmaking and scoring responsibilities ... As an NBA prospect, his maturity, leadership, high IQ and complete overall skill set should be enough to get his name called somewhere in the second round ... Winning on the biggest stage for the most respected coach in college basketball will only help his draft stock ..."
"Strengths: One of the best three point shooters in the NCAA, hitting over 50% his senior year … At 6-6, can get his shot up over most defenders … Nearly limitless range on his jumper … Doesn’t get enough credit for his passing ability … High basketball IQ, very effective at finding openings on the perimeter … Complements his jumpshot with very effective pump fakes … Not afraid to put the ball on the floor to create space for himself … Gets down the floor well in transition … Always finds a way to set his feet, allowing him to be effective making moves and shots while off balance … Incredibly efficient scorer, especially for somebody who spends his time on the perimeter…Jumpshot mechanics are impeccable … Takes care of the basketball, averaging less than a turnover a game despite playing big minutes … Excellent shot selection. Rarely takes bad shots ... Actually shows surprising leaping ability ... 

Weaknesses: Fairly one dimensional player … Thin frame will result in him being pushed around on defense … Doesn’t possess great speed or quickness … Lacks the speed and athleticism of an NBA guard … Streaky shooter who if he goes cold struggles to impact the game… Not physical. Doesn’t get to the free throw line enough for an 82% shooter … Lacks star power … Limited potential … Looks destined to spend his career as a shooter coming off the bench … Only average lateral quickness will result in him struggling to defend quicker players ...

Notes: Tied Big Ten Conference single game record with 10 three point field goals on 12 attempts against Penn St."
"NBA Comparison: Louis Amundson

Strengths: High energy post player who excels at doing the dirty work, in particular rebounding, defending and banging in the post ... Plays with exuberance and aggressiveness ... An above average, fluid athlete who is willing to sacrifice his body ... Huge hands help him to secure rebounds. Athletic body ... An excellent run/jump athlete with explosive leaping ability ... His long arms and explosiveness help to compensate for his lack of ideal size ... One of the most dominant interior forces on the college level, leads the nation in rebounds at 13.3 rpg ... A good shot blocker with timing and instincts ... Also extremely active defensively - leading the OVC in steals at 2.3 per game, very impressive for a bigman ... Offensive game has shown solid improvement ... His lack of versatility and offense actually makes him a stronger role player as he focuses most of his time and energy on improving his rebounding, defense and post play ... Has a great feel for positioning and using his length and quickness to gather rebounds ... An excellent out of area rebounder ... Competes hard, seems to have tireless energy ... Has a developing jump hook shot that he has added to his repertoire ... 

Weaknesses: Undersized both in height (6'8) and weight (225 lbs) to play the 4 position at the NBA level ... Has to overcome the disadvantages of playing at Morehead, Kentucky in a smaller (Ohio Valley) Conference ... Scouts are less likely to give credence to standout stats against lesser opponents ... Needs to further develop his post skills. His moves are too predictable even against lesser competition ... Lacks any real face the basket skills. Touch and consistency are not great. Scores mostly on put backs and buckets where he gains deep position in the paint, or is able to outclass opponents with his athleticism ... A poor free throw shooter at below 60% throughout his college career. Doesn't have terrible form, but needs to focus and improve his routine some ... Passing and vision are limited. Needs to decrease turnovers. Gets far too many giveaways for someone that doesn't really use the bounce to set up baskets nor look to create offense for others ... Average at finishing non-dunks around the basket ... 

Notes: Declared early but withdrew from the 2010 NBA draft ... Considered a possible late first round pick by scouts for the 2011 NBA draft ... The recent success of undersized power forwards (Millsap, Blair, Maxiell, etc) helps his cause ... Has drawn comparisons to Dennis Rodman and had a chance to speak with his idol who advised him to approach every rebound as if it were his ... 

Aran Smith 1/22/11"
"Strengths: Macklin's most attractive strength surrounds his physical tools, where at 6'9 243 lbs, he possesses a 7'4 wingspan and 9'1 standing reach ... He's a solid athlete whose explosiveness allows him to do damage around the hoop... Moves well on both sides of the ball... Offensively, his biggest strength is his over the left shoulder baby hook when he establishes deep positioning on the interior... Macklin spends the majority of his time in the paint, where he's improved his post game in terms of efficiency, but not in terms of diversity... Defensively he has potential to be an effective post defender with his mobility, strength and length...

Weaknesses: His glaring weakness is his non-existent midrange game ... Facing the basket is not in his repertoire, nor does it look to be in his near future ...One-dimensional offensively, without an array of post moves or an outside game... shot 45% from line... only 2.8 free throw attempts per game, illustrating his inability to force his defender out of position ... His rebounding numbers were alarmingly low, especially on the defensive glass at only 3.2 per game... Could be a liability defending away from the basket... Already 24 years old, which will deflate his stock as an NBA prospect considering his limited offensive game ...

Overall: Was a top 10 recruit coming out of high school ... Macklin transfered to Florida after 2 years at Georgetown... Physically he fits the mold of an NBA power forward, but at 24 years old and little polish to his game, replacing someone in a rotation seems unlikely at this point... 

Tyler Ingle 6/22/11"
"Strengths: A 6’10” forward with potential. Actually the potential has already become a reality this season with Real Madrid, one of the traditional powerhouses and present at the recently played Euroleague Final Four. A good frame ... Yet he shows good balance, mobility and also a very nice wingspan ... He’s got pretty good hands and a soft shooting touch, offering good reliability from beyond the arch up to the foul line. Shot selection is really excellent ... He's also willing to take the big shots to help win games ... Might not be the quickest shooter, but his release and rhythm are good and he can create shots off the dribble when necessary. Able to score from the outside, able to penetrate and also a skilled low post player with a variety of moves ... He handles the ball well with both hands for a guy of his size, and often helps to dribble the ball up court when the guard is being overplayed. Offensively Mirotic is tremendously versatile. Even if he's missing better strength and athleticism, a good first step and very controlled drives gets him to draw many fouls. Adding to that a very high basketball IQ, good court awareness and anticipation, which allows him to make very quick decisions once he receives the ball. Spin moves (including over baseline foot), left and right up and unders and jump hooks, turn around jumpers, 45 degrees bank shots and shotfakes all form in a natural part of his repertoire. And he’s a reliable finisher inside. Apart from scoring himself, he contributes in the functioning of his team by making the ball move around on the perimeter. He also knows how to post up, seal off his position and maintain it. Being a good passer with an even better court vision enables him to find his teammates from the low post or out of dribble when driving towards the basket. In offensive rebounding he continuously tries to find a good position, often succeeding follow ups or at least getting touches to obtain a new possession. Defending pick and roll isn’t an issue either, considering his physical assets to hedge and recuperate as required. At this point defensively he can be matched up with both small and power forwards. Not a great shotblocker in the way of a top leaper who goes for each shot, nonetheless he manages to block a fair share of them due to very good help side positioning, timing and awareness. 

Weaknesses: Even though agility and leaping are just average, surprisingly he’s quite quick off his feet and is able to run the floor well when he puts his mind to it ... Over the years, there have been moments where a lack of motivation and concentration affected his running effort and activity on offense ... Overall I would catalogue his athleticism as just okay for NBA standards ... Has a good frame but will need to add additional strength ... He is a better set shooter than creating shots for himself ... He’s much more effective in half court offenses than in one on one fastbreak situations. When he’s on the receiving end in pick and roll plays, he mostly steps out the 3 point line and continues just occasionally inside. Even though he usually does box out and picks up defensive rebounds, rebounding is an aspect that he can still improve significantly. Whereas he can successfully defend speed (in Europe), against power it’s a lot more complicated. He’s unable to stop somebody who takes him one on one to the basket, as his body lacks the strength to contain many players ... 

Notes: Spanish naturalized, born in Montenegro. In Europe expect Mirotic to become and remain a very important player for any of the top teams for many years to come. Without any doubt he has absolute Euroleague star player potential. However for his development and to get the maximum out of his basketball career, the situation where he ends up might be crucial to making it or not across the Atlantic."
 
"Strengths: Macvan fits the mold of a typical European big man ... He is very skilled big man with high basketball IQ and size for his position ... Has ability to play effectively on the low post and take advantage of his size against smaller defenders./not afraid of banging on the post in order to get good position ... He likes turning to his left shoulder and use right hand baby-hook ... Passes the ball well of the post/very unselfish player that will find teammates open if he is double-teamed ... Posses good ball handling ability for his size and will take his opponents off the dribble with one or two dribbles ... Macvan does a good job at rebounding the ball and using his size to box out/scores points of 2nd shot opportunities ... Good in p&r situations as well as p&p/posses range on his shot and not afraid of shooting the ball from behind the 3pt line ... Coachable player and nice kid off the floor. 

Weaknesses:  Lack of athleticism and explosiveness for NBA ... Struggles guarding quicker and more athletic players than him ... Macvan has to improve his lateral quickness and hedge on screens/doesn’t recover back quick enough. Would need time adjusting at the speed of the game in the NBA ... 

Aran Smith 6/22/11"
"Strengths: Brooks gradually increased his scoring average in each of his four years at Providence, finishing his senior year second in the country in scoring at 24.6 points per game ... At 6'5, Brooks has nice size for an NBA two guard, but it's his length that should allow him to get his shot off at the next level ... He has an uncanny ability to create his own shot, using a variety of change of speed/hesitation dribble moves to create separation moving East/West or North/South ... He's proven capable of shooting both off the dribble and off catch and release situations, and has range out to the NBA three point line ... His first step allows him to get into the lane, where he displays impressive body control that allows him to hit off balance shots around the rim ... His long arms and high activity level also help contribute to 7 rebounds per game ... With his length and capable lateral quickness, Brooks has the potential to be an effective defender with more focus and NBA coaching...

Weaknesses: The ball has the tendency to stick to Brooks' hands, causing teammates to stand around forcing stagnant and one and done offensive possessions ... Doesn't show the best shot selection, and throws up too many unnecessary heat checks ... Physically he lacks the athleticism and explosiveness that most scoring NBA two-guards possess ... He averaged close to 18 field goal attempts per game, so his scoring average could be inflated due to his role in Providence's offense ... He won't have the opportunity to dominate the ball in the pros the way he does in college, so adjusting his spacing and adapting to his teammates could be a challenge for him in a new role ... His body has good length but lacks great bulk/strength ... Needs to put forth more intensity and effort on the defensive end ... 

Overall: On one hand, Brooks led the most competitive conference in basketball in scoring including a 43 point game against Georgetown and a 52 point game against Notre Dame. On the other hand, his team went 4-14 in conference play and he averaged more turnovers than assists... Brooks needs to improve on his complimentary skills such as spot up shooting and making the extra pass, but his overall ability to score will be an attractive asset for many teams looking for some extra fire power."
"Strengths: A winner who leaves Purdue tied for the most wins (107) in program history in his 4 years … Productive and efficient player who put up good scoring totals … Has a nice jumper, and it is definitely the pillar of his offensive game … Can make shots spotting up, coming off screens, in isolation, and in the pick and roll … A quick, easy release and supreme confidence in his shot…Solid ability to make shots with a hand in his face …Very crafty and instinctive about how he creates his offense … Rarely seems rushed on the floor … Takes care of the ball…Possesses strong basic passing skills … Developed his ball-handling steadily over his career … Effective pick and roll player…Steady on-ball defender who plays with toughness and good fundamentals … Possesses a 6’9 wingspan that will help him on the defensive end, despite his mediocre athletic and physical tools

Weaknesses: Moore isn’t very athletic … Not very explosive or quick … Will struggle to drive the lane in the NBA, and will find it even harder to finish at the rim … 1st step is below average and ball-handling is mediocre at best … Struggled to get separation on his drives in college … Not going to break down anyone off the dribble…Has a hard time creating good shots when defended by more athletic defenders who can crowd him … Often will shoot highly contested pull-up jump shots when he can’t get to the rim … Mediocre to below average size for a SG ... Some teams may want him to be a combo guard, but he’s definitely not a PG … Won’t handle the ball as much as he did at Purdue … Can be inconsistent from game-to-game as a shooter … Can be beaten off the dribble by quick guards and savvy ball-handlers … Needs to get stronger and bigger to deal with the SG’s he’ll face in the pros

Notes: One of the most productive players in this draft and a classic overachiever, Moore could have a future as an off-ball shooter and steady defender in the NBA. He’s tough and comes from one of the best defensive teams in the NCAA. His below average athleticism and physical tools hold him back, but he’s winning pedigree and production could get him picked in the 2nd round."

Able to use his strength and size (6'8.5"" in shoes with a 6'9.5"" wingspan) in the post against smaller players ... Adept at getting open without the ball ... A spot-up shooter who doesn't hesitate to fire if left open ... Shows great shooting mechanics ... Release is very high and very quick ... Squares up to the rim quickly ... Range is already well beyond the NBA three-point line, showing the ability to make shots 25-28 feet from the basket ... Volume shooter, making 2.5 threes a game during his sophomore season (38.5%) ... Doesn't need a lot of room to get his shot off ... Adapted very well to the ""Jerry Sloan offense"" implemented on the Longhorns by head coach Rick Barnes, which suggests he is capable of playing well in an advanced offensive system at the next level ... Strong rebounder for a wing player (7.7 rebounds per game) thanks to his size and tenacity ... Solid passer who is capable of finding teammates when they are open ... Good open court speed, with a willingness to push and a good understanding of how to finish fast-break opportunities ..."

Great free throw shooter (80.9%) that gets to the stripe a lot (209 attempts in 2010-2011) ... Moves his feet well on defense ... Big-time shot blocker, averaging 2.3 per game ... Had a successful 4-year career at Purdue ...

Weaknesses: Lacks bulk ... Doesn't appear to have the frame that can support much more weight in the future ... Gets pushed around when trying to defend players in the post ... Offensively he prefers to play in the post, but there are questions about whether this will translate to the next level where just about every power forward will be bigger than he is ... Will have trouble establishing and maintaining good position down low ... Somewhat of a tweener ... Doesn't have the strength of a power forward, but doesn't have the perimeter skills of a small forward ... Poor ball-handling ability ... Cannot create offense for himself on the perimeter ... He isn't the rebounder that someone with his size and athleticism could be ...

Overall: Johnson is an NBA athlete, but there are questions regarding his position and skill-set ... Does he have the frame to support more weight? Can he hold his own in the post against bigger players? ... If a team is confident that he'll be able to contribute, he could find a spot in the late-1st round ...

NBA Comparison: Tony Douglas
"Strengths: Physically, the 6”10 Majok posses tremendous length (7”4 wingspan) with above average athleticism, and able to carry the additional weight (240 lbs now) without any decline in agility ... He is comfortable using both hands and shows good timing when going after shots ... He alters numerous plays and has the capacity to be a formidable post and help defender ... Desite his slight frame, he isn’t afraid of physical play, hustles hard and will get after loose balls ... He gets to the line where he had made over 70% of his foul shots since leaving UCONN ... Majok runs the floor well for a big man and also has quick enough feet and the length to be an effective perimeter defender … Offensively, he is more comfortable facing the basket, however has shown nice moves and a soft touch from the low block ... He makes good use of shot and pass fakes in the half court and has demonstrated the ability to correctly use pivots when around the basket … He possesses a decent outside shot with three point range, good mechanics with a high release, making his jump shot nearly impossible to block (his jump shoot looked impressive in game in treviso) ... Has a decent handle for a player his size, is a good pick and pop option that can also put the ball on the floor … Majok has displayed the ability and willingness to find the open man … He is a vocal teammate and an intense competitor ... 

Weaknesses: Majok is turning 24 in July 2011 and hasn’t yet completed a full season in his short career. He therefore hasn’t had the consistent level of competition, experience and coaching that most of his peers have received ... There are concerns his feel for the game is behind schedule as a result ... As a shot blocker, Majok tends to go after any shot taken within 8ft of the rim. His judgment on when to challenge shots and when to keep his feet on defense should improve with further experience ... He is currently prone to picking up cheap fouls and the occasional goal tend due to his exuberance ... Although he has sound footwork, it could still use some tightening up reduce the risk of turnovers when putting the ball on the floor ... For his size and athleticism, Majok hasn’t been the best rebounder throughout his short career either ... He is active on the offensive boards and finds his man on the defensive end, however due to mainly his lack of strength in the past, he has not been a dominant rebounder up to this point ... He has also had some difficulties with foul trouble playing the 4/5 spot ... Without the ball, he will need to focus on setting effective picks and making more decisive cuts. 

Overall: Majok has had a patchy career so far and has taken an unusual path to the NBA draft. His decision to declare for the 2009 draft before even playing a college game was criticized ... The feedback he received and lessons learned from that experience however, assisted him in preparing for this year’s draft ... He will more than likely spend at least the next season in Europe where he can further develop his skills ... His game does need refining however he has some obvious tools at his disposal ... He has bulked up some during the pre-draft process and is now closer to 240, and carries that weight extremely well ... With continued hard work and development, we haven’t ruled out Majok cracking the league at some stage in the next couple of years ... Although he would come relatively cheap, making the Lakers roster next season is highly unlikely ..."
"Strengths: Young lead guard with upside ... Has ideal size for a point guard in the NBA, standing 6'3.25"" in shoes with a 6'5.5"" wingspan ... Well-rounded athlete ... Good speed with the ball in his hands ... Solid strength with the frame to potentially add a little more muscle ... Aggressive in transition, displaying good instincts and finishing ability ... Great perimeter shooting ability ... A very natural spot-up shooter from mid to long range ... Shot a very respectable 41.3% from behind the arc this season ... Adequate passing ability and he doesn't turn the ball over a lot (averaged over 2 assists per turnover) ... Keeps his teammates involved ... Not a selfish player by any stretch ... Only recently turned 20 years old and has a lot of room to improve ... A very solid defender with strong potential. Rick Barnes called him the best defensive guard he's had ... Very solid person, impressive character ... 

Weaknesses: Very green as a prospect and leaving college so prematurely as a PG could severely inhibit his long term development ... Is currently more of a shooter than a scorer ... Very raw as a floor general and some question if he's more of a combo than true PG ... Shared ball-handling responsibilities at Texas, and never had the chance to really show off his creativity with the ball ... Not used to creating offense for himself off the dribble ... Doesn't look comfortable around the rim ... Great shooting numbers from outside, but shot only 42.8% from inside the arc which points to his mediocre slashing/cutting skills ... Playmaking ability has potential, but he has a lot to learn before he can be considered a quality full-time point guard ... 

Overall: Ideally Joseph would have stayed another few years at Texas where he could have continued to see a lot of playing time and improve his all-around game ... Instead he chose to take advantage of the weak draft class and declare as a freshman with the hopes of being drafted now instead of competing with incoming point guard Myck Kabongo next season ... Could be an interesting second round pick if a team falls in love with his potential and is willing to invest in and wait for him ...

"Strengths: Crafty scorer who can find holes in the defense … Passing skills have developed nicely over the past season … Has a knack for coming up big in the clutch … Good speed … Excellent quickness with a first step that allows him to blow by defenders … Natural leader … Measured better than expected at combine … Fantastic athletic aptitude with nice leaping ability … Able to deceive defenders with ball fakes while on the move … Able to get into the paint and create … Excellent at using his body to protect the ball from bigger, stronger opponents … Capable shooter with range to the three point line

Weaknesses: Very small, even for a point guard … Ability to get inside will be largely negated by the size of NBA players … Shoot first point guard who sometimes struggles with turnovers … Will struggle to matchup with NBA guards defensively … Sometimes hurts his team by trying to make highlight reel plays instead of making the simple pass … Prone to over-dribbling … Spent much of his time in college playing shooting guard … Will force his offense at times … Can get caught trying to leak out for fast breaks too often ...

Strength: Very long physical tools with endless arms (nicknamed the octopus) ... Solid shooter out to 15 feet ... Shows a high motor ... Competes hard ... Very good shotblocker, showing good anticipation ... Very solid frame, that could easily take on some more mass ... Is not afraid to bang inside ... Due to his size/length, an excellent rebounder ... Very good pick and roll player with excellent fundamentals ... Still very young being nearly a 90 born. Plays solid minutes against quality competition.

Weaknesses: Not a great athlete. Somewhat stiff ... Although he's got length he's very earthbound ... Underdeveloped post-up game, scores mainly on offensive rebounds and dunks ... In the past had some medical problems with his feet due to rapid weight increase ... Needs a mental coach to manage dealing with disappointments.

"NBA Comparison: Brandon Roy

Strengths: Big combo guard with great versatility and a tremendous feel for the game ... Extremely smooth with the ball in his hands and has a bag of tricks offensively ... His handles are that of a point guards and he has a terrific ability of getting to the basket ... Has supreme confidence with the ball in his hands, excellent handle and a nasty crossover ... Slick mid-range game with the ability to change directions and get defenders off balance to create looks ... Good upperbody strength allows him to absorb contact and make plays at the rim ... Strong finisher. Very adept at finishing after contact. Also utilizes the glass effectively ... Has a nifty runner when he meets up with shot blockers in the paint ... Understands how to use his body to shield the ball from opponents ... Has a great pull up jumper and his ability to drive really sets up his ability to pull up for shots ... Utilizes the spin dribble to get by opponents effectively and into the paint ... Creative playmaker with the ability to find others for shots when his path to the basket gets cut off ... Solid vision and a good passer capable of finding the open man ... An above average athlete with good speed and long arms ... Makes a lot of impressive plays at the basket using excellent body control and creativity ... A solid shooter with good form ... Has a big wingspan (near 7-foot). His long arms allow him to disrupt passing lanes ... Draws a lot of fouls on drives due to his aggressiveness ... Runs down a lot of loose balls and makes plays based on sheer desire and hustle ... Plays with a high level of intensity at all times no matter the game situation ... A student of the game who studies past greats and appears to have a great understanding ... Solid free throw shooter at 79% ... 

Weaknesses: Not a freak athlete, but above average by NBA standards with great length ... At times appears to be susceptible to being thrown off his game by physical play ... A better scorer than shooter, while Turner shot 44% from 3 as a sophomore it was on a low volume of shots ... Should look to improve his catch and shoot ability and expand his range and consistency from the perimeter ... His effectiveness going towards the basket with the ball probably keeps him from polishing his outside game, but with such efficiency driving it's hard to ask him to shoot more from the perimeter ... Struggled in the clutch in OSU's loss to Siena in the tournament ... At times can fall in love with the dribble and become too ball dependent, but he's very effective so that's nit picking to a degree ... His creativity can lead to being a little careless passing the ball ... Not great at setting defenders up off of screens and shooting spot up. He prefers to create a rhythm with the ball in his hands dribbling off screens or creating off isolation ...

"NBA Comparison: Stanley Roberts

Strengths: A physically imposing low post player … Has continued to work on his body, losing a lot of weight and improving his conditioning ... Very efficient scorer ... He has a very strong and wide frame and he is able to create room and muscle his way around the hoop … Operating on the low block he is able to establish terrific position and is also very capable of making tough catches in traffic ... He uses his strength to force his way to the hoop, overpowering defenders for easy finishes inside ... Has a nice mini hook going to his left shoulder ... A good athlete for his size, he has the explosiveness to catch and finish strong at the rim ... Extremely effective rebounder on the offensive end, he clears space and attacks the glass ... Shows good timing and is able to block a lot of shots in the paint ... 

Weaknesses: Has no ability to step out and shoot jumpers or put it on the floor, which limits him strictly to the center position and at 6'10 he is a bit undersized ... Even with his improved physique, his motor is still very much a question mark ... He has problems staying in the game for long stretches ... Extremely foul prone, he is fairly undisciplined and doesn't move his feet ... Does not operate well with or finish to his left hand ... Extremely poor foul shooter ... 

Borko Popic 6/22/10

Strengths: Mammoth of a man who has made enormous strides developing his game. Has dropped over 70 pounds since arriving on the UT campus, from 366 to the 290 range -- showing his work ethic and desire to make use of his frame ... Attended the Pete Newell Big Man Camp in the summer of 2008 ... His quickness, agility and feel for the game continue to improve year in and year out ... Has enormous hands. and very soft hands for a man his size ... Has shown a deft touch around the rim (career 59% from the field) and at the free throw line (73% as junior) ... Has good release and follow through on FT stroke ... Uses his large frame to seal off opponents in the paint with relative ease ... Finishes strong at the hoop ... Was extremely passive and unsure of himself early on his college career, but has developed a mean-streak to his game ... Takes advantage of his size and punishes smaller opponents ... Has improved his quickness off the floor, averaging nearly three offensive boards per game as a Jr ... His pet move is a drop step into the lane with a short baby hook ... Extremely bright kid, was Academic All-Big 12 as a sophomore.

Weaknesses: Stamina is a major concern. Still only seeing 15 minutes of playing time per contest ... Despite loss of weight, movement up and down the court is still an issue and can be painful at times ... He will always be a 'lumberer' ... Foul trouble usually emerges as a result of fatigue ... He averages a foul every 5 minutes on the court ... He has made massive improvements in lateral quickness and agility, but these will always be flaws ... Has a tendency to push off on the offensive and defensive glass, committing unnecessary fouls. Always enjoys a major size advantage against big 12 competition. He will not enjoy this same distinct advantage against opposing Center's in the NBA ... Still brings the ball down too low in the paint, leveling the playing field against smaller foes allowing them to slap it away ... Has not shown any semblance of a face up game or midrange jumper. Needs to continue to develop in these areas, as well as continued improvement in his post game, physical strength and stamina ...

Strengths: A legit 7-footer with excellent size, strength and potential ... Has good agility and run/jump athleticism ... Very intriguing combination of physical attributes (7-feet and 230 lbs with a 7-6 wingspan) and an explosive athlete ... Imposing defensive presence due to his length and leaping ability ... Already a force defensively averaging 4.4 blocks per game in just over 20 minutes per game (through his first 7 games) ... An excellent rebounder, using his size and strength well on the glass at both ends ... Shows an exuberance for the game and should continue to develop as he gains experience ... Shows some nice things offensively with developing post skills and touch on his shot ... He is still in the early stages in his offensive development, so sticking around college 2-3 years would benefit him in the long run ... 

Weaknesses: Still a work in progress offensively. At times looks awkward in the post but appears to be gaining confidence ... He's born in 1989, so he's nearly 2 years older than the average freshman. But his upside is unmistakable ... Needs to work on his free throw shooting (currently shooting below 40%) ... Feel for the game is still raw, but not terrible ... Still needs to develop his upperbody strength (at 230) but has a solid frame and muscle mass to work with ... Needs to develop his passing skills to find teammates when doubled ... Should work on his post skills and develop better range on his shot ... Also must look to become more sure handed and cut down on turnovers, although he shows soft hands, and should be fine as he gains experience ...

"NBA Comparison: Eddie Johnson/Shawn Marion

Strengths: Wes has all the tools, and fits the description of your classic athletic small forward ... He's quick and slippery when maneuvering in the lane ... At 6'7, he has a huge wingspan (easily over 7' feet), and tremendous leaping abilities which allow him to rise above traffic around the rim ... He has a smooth and fluent motion on his jump shot, and gets nice elevation ... Has a strong mid-range game that will only get better ... Can spot up from short or deep, but seems to excel at shooting off one dribble after his quick first step enables him to create space between him and his defender... When he doesn't shoot off the dribble, he uses an effective jab step to create separation and get off his shot, a must-have tool for a scoring small forward in the NBA ... Also has deep range with a high and quick release, and his consistency will only improve - his 3 point percentage has gradually risen from 29% to 33% to 39% respectively in each of his 3 years... He shoots 50% from the field overall, and does not need 20 plus shots to be effective ... Extremely unselfish, the offense rarely becomes stagnant when the ball is in his hands, a tendency other teams have when their go-to player tries to isolate himself ... An underrated passer showing excellent vision and passing skills for a 3 ... He moves extremely well off the ball, and does a great job of getting himself open off back screens ... Wes can run the floor and finish effectively in transition ... His quickness, awareness and long wingspan come into play defensively as well, as he is a terrific off-ball and help defender ... Can quickly move from the weak-side to ball-side, and uses those long arms and high leaping abilities to block an average of 2 shots per game ... He's athletic and long enough to play effective on-ball defense at the next level ... His wingspan and leaping abilities also make him an excellent rebounder, and his persistent nature and good nose for the ball make him a pest on theoffensive glass ...
 
Weaknesses: Sometimes Wes settles or relies too much on his jump shot, and when it's not on that day, he can disappear for long stretches throughout the game ... Needs to bulk up- when guarded by stronger defenders, he tends to pull back for tougher jump shots as opposed to taking it strong and drawing the foul ... Attempts less than 4 free throws per game ... Tries to get out of slumps by shooting jumpers instead of being more aggressive ... Has not developed much of a back-to-the-basket game yet, but his skills, high release and length give him a shot to develop a post game over time ... Has trouble creating off the dribble, most of his opportunities come after one dribble or a catch and shoot ... Not much of a playmaker, his ball handling skills are average, and he tends to throw the ball away too often ... He's 23 years old, so his upside and potential might take a hit when GMs look at guys who are up to 3 years younger ...

Overall: A widely unknown transfer from Iowa State, Wes Johnson had to wait a year on the sidelines before becoming a household name and a star for Syracuse basketball ... Plays a lot of the 4 in college, but will most definitely be a 3 at the next level. At 23 years old already, he should be more NBA ready than most players entering the draft ... The big question with Wes is whether or not his inability to create will prevent him from being a relied upon scorer in the pros ... Regardless, his smile can light up an arena and make him an immediate fan favorite, while his ability to shoot with hands in his face, as well as his defensive potential and rebounding skills, should propel him to the next level, making him a likely high lottery pick in the 2010 NBA Draft.

Strengths: Figures to be the top transfer in the nation in 2009-10 … Long, athletic wing with a strong offensive game … Has a picture perfect jumpshot with excellent lift and good range. Gets his jump shot off quickly and has a knack for shooting effectively even with defenders in his face … Creates shots very well in isolation … Has an excellent handle and shoots very well off the dribble … An above average athlete who excels in the open floor … Big wingspan (7-foot) gives him an edge defensively and rebounding … 

Weaknesses: Born in 1987, after sitting out a year with his transfer from Iowa State is one of the older players in the country … His upside will be questioned due to his age … Not an overpowering athlete. Lacks great strength to finish after contact and overpower opponents … Added strength would allow him to use his length to finish at the rim … Must become more efficient offensively. Despite his excellent shooting ability from the perimeter, his stats in his first two college seasons tell a different story as he shot just 29% and 33% in his FR and SO years … Likes to camp out at the 3 point stripe and spot up, but he’s more efficient shooting off the dribble … Despite his proficiency at shooting without much daylight, he should look to improve his shot selection … Gets careless passing the ball off the dribble … His handle needs to be tightened … Vision is questionable. Needs to learn better decision making when attacking the basket ...

A lefty with excellent one on one skills and the ability to create baskets off the dribble ... Has a pretty lefty pull up off the dribble ... Gets excellent lift on his shot and has a fluid release ... First step is extremely fast making him a tough player to stay in front of ... Shows excellent ball handling ability and the vision to find open teammates for baskets ... While he's not a natural at creating offense for others, he has shown improvement in that area ... Owns an effective crossover ... Fearless going inside and challenging bigger opponents and finishing drives with floaters or attacking the rim ... His body strength allows him to absorb contact and still finish ... Solid 75% ft shooter ... Has a good feel for the pick and roll ... Defensively he doesn't get a ton of steals but does a solid job of using his size and quickness to neutralize opposing guards ... Doesn't gamble much, plays solid fundamental defense ... Has shown steady improvement over his 3 years at Reno ... Has proven to be a clutch performer ... 

Weaknesses: His point guard skills are good but not great ... Still must become a better passer and learn to control the tempo and set up teammates in the half court. He is much more adept at creating offense for himself ... Gets a little out of control in transition so will need to work on his decision making there ... Must continue to develop his half court floor general abilities ... Needs to cut down on his turnovers (3.8 per) but has a respectable 1.50 a/to ratio ... Not much of a 3 point threat. Needs to improve upon shooting from the perimeter ... Should look to become more of a vocal leader ... Learning better anticipation defensively would help him become more aof a ball hawk and use his length to jump passing lanes ...

"Strengths: An extremely versatile player, capable of playing a number of positions thanks to his size and ability to handle the ball … Has a great feel for the game and makes plays thanks to his natural basketball ability … He is a playmaker and is able to create scoring opportunities for teammates thanks to his great vision, ability to see overtop of defenses and passing precision … He sees the floor well in transition and in the halfcourt, keeping his head up and looking to make reads … Plays the pick&roll well, can shoot overtop the screen, off the dribble, or make the play with the pass … Has become a very reliable shooter, he has extended his range and is now very dangerous from beyond the arc … He is a good spotup shooter, but is much more dangerous creating his shot off the dribble … Shoots a well balanced and good rhythm midrange pullup, making it very difficult to contest because of his size and high release point … Handles the ball with ease, and has a nice mix of change of pace and direction moves … Can play as the primary ballhandler but is also very good in a point-forward type of role … Has a great nose for the ball in terms of rebounding, he hangs around the basket and gets a high number of missed shots … Plays on a fairly bad team, but continues to play the right way without dominating the ball and forcing bad shots … 

Weaknesses: Does not have great explosiveness, both in terms of a first step and leaping ability … Struggles against smaller and quicker defenders who are able to get into his legs and force him out of driving lanes … His body is still very skinny and he lacks the muscle to finish against contact … He is not a good finisher around the basket, he looks to finesse his shot inside and does not convert at a high percentage … He is a streaky and rhythm player, he can go for long stretches where he has a very low impact on the game … Does not play with great aggressiveness, he plays soft at times and doesn’t look to attack … He is not ball strong, getting stripped often when slashing to the basket … He becomes too unselfish and will pass up very good looks to get teammates the ball in worse positions … Has a tendency to throw passes while in the air, causing him to get caught without any targets …Will have problems defending a position at the next level, his body is too weak to battle inside and he is not quick enough laterally to stay infront of wings … At this point he doesn’t put a lot of energy into playing defense and gets beaten of the dribble on a regular basis … Needs to become more effective playing off the ball … 

Notes: He is a player who is much more effective with the ball in his hands where he can be the facilitator and create plays for teammates and himself, his success at the next level could be heavily influenced on how much freedom he is given to operate with the ball …"
"Strengths: Skilled power forward with a long, lean frame. Has a 7'4 1/2 wingspan ... Nicknamed ""The Nightmare"" for his demonic shot blocking prowess (3.7 per game as junior) ... Views swatting shots as an art form - always taking proper angles, never leaving his feet until his opponent does, can block shots with either hand and keeps balls in play ... Tremendous offensive rebounder as a result of his length and quickness off the floor (3.6 off, 9.8 total) ... Exhibits solid agility on the perimeter, able to stay in front of quicker guards on pick and roll switches ... Moves his feet well and lateral quickness is much improved ... Has made dramatic developments in his offensive repertoire since his sophomore season at Michigan ... Much more aggressive looking to score (14 ppg) ... Shows the ability to face up opponents with his quick first step and new and improved ball handling skills ... His passing ability and court vision have been a revelation, often acting as a facilitator in Baylor's offense (2.7 ast) ... Reads double teams well and finds the open man. His post skills are on the incline exhibiting solid foot work and a series of quick moves ... Prefers a one power dribble jump hook. Has nice touch on his short range and mid-range jumper ... Has shown flashes of range this season knocking down 7 three pointers. Shooting form is near textbook ... Runs the floor very well for a big. His work ethic can be easily detected in his development as a player in a short period of time ... Has developed some face the basket skills, but will never be confused for being a small forward ... 

Weaknesses: Despite improvements, still has a very raw offensive game ... Has the skills, but many subtleties are not yet second nature. Not smooth in the post, often looking uncomfortable and indecisive on what move to attempt ... What is his offensive game? Can do a variety of things, but has no real go to move ... Has struggled with turnovers problems, attempting low percentage passes and overdribbling (2.4 to) ... Needs to add weight and get stronger, especially in his lower body ... Has difficulty holding his ground on defense and maintaining interior position on offense ... Does not finish plays through contact ... Only attempted 4.5 free throws per game last season ... A solid run/jump athlete but lacks explosiveness. Effort on the defensive backboard can be questioned- lackadaisical on box out assignments quite frequently ... Does not play with a killer instinct and needs to get tougher ... Will turn 23 in May making his upside somewhat limited. Ability to add significant strength at this stage of his development is doubtful.

Weaknesses: Scouts have mentioned him being a borderline discipline guy with some slight character concerns, although he has not gotten into any trouble while at Mississippi and in the combine tests he had the lowest body fat of all players which contradicts any issues related to work ethic … Can be too aggressive at times and force the issue both passing and shooting … Also a little too much of a showman who can get caught up in trying to impress instead of making the sound play … Shot selection the biggest reason for his average shooting numbers. Forces too many ill-advised shots with defenders in his face … Did not break out into the superstar that some envisioned in his sophomore campaign. How much of that was due to playing in a crowded backcourt (along with Chris Warren and Eniel Polynice) is up for debate … Averaged just 1.5 apg, but that was mostly due to playing off the ball … While his versatility is a plus, his inability to truly fit a position is also a drawback … Appears small for the SG position (6’3.75 barefoot) … Shooting numbers are in need of improvement across the board (43% fg, 71% ft, 34% 3p) …
